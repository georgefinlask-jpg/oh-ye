subtitle: "The day we met and my first impressions o((>ω< ))o",
content: `

I still remember how we first met, and honestly, it’s funny looking back at it now (not in a bad way, omkiee?).

During EDGE, I didn’t like you at first. (At first lang pod, karon kay more than like naman, HAHA.) Mostly because my friend didn’t like you, and I just went along with that. I never thought we’d end up being friends, ESPECIALLYY not the way we are now. Back then, you were just someone I didn’t pay much attention to. 🤯

Then the first week of classes happened. Ma’am Pat changed the seating arrangement, and I was placed on the 3rd row, 2nd column from the right. You were on my left. At first, I was ulaw to talk to you. I didn’t know what to say, and I wasn’t even sure I wanted to talk. My first impression of you was that you were smart and loud, please don’t get offended, first impression lang gyud nako back then.

But then you started talking to me. And we talked a lot, like, ALLAT. OMD AHAHA. Without me realizing it, you became my first friend in Pisay. You were there when I didn’t understand the lessons, when I doubted myself, and when I needed someone to explain things patiently. You never made me feel stupid or small. You just helped. :3

That’s when my impression of you started to change. I began to see you as kind, humble, and genuine. Good thoughts about you slowly replaced the old ones jdasdafeih. And somewhere along the way, very gradually, I started catching feelings. I didn’t expect it, but it happened. 🤯😛

It wasn’t anything grand or dramatic. It was your personality. The way you made me feel comfortable. The way I could tell you things without fear of being judged. You became someone I felt safe with, someone I trusted, someone who made things feel lighter just by being there. And honestly, we’re so ka-vibeee, like on the same freakuency, (we were both a bit freaky back then, HAHA.) being around you just clicks, everything fits perfectly. :>

And now, thinking about how it all started, I can’t help but smile. From disliking you, to sitting beside you, to calling you my first friend, and then something more. I guess life really has its own way of surprising us. 😸😺`

subtitle: "Why I Chose You",
content: `
I didn’t want to be in a relationship ever again. Not for a short while, not for a long while, not casually, and not seriously. I had been through experiences before that left me drained and hesitant. I was afraid that if I let myself love again, I might end up hurting myself, repeating past mistakes that I had struggled to move on from.

Yet, when I met you, something changed, yie haha. There was a subtle pull I couldn’t ignore, a feeling I hadn’t experienced in a long time. I didn’t immediately understand it, and perhaps I still can’t fully explain it, but it was strong enough to make me notice you in a way I hadn’t noticed anyone else.

At first, it was small things that caught my attention. The way you carried yourself, your natural confidence, and the way you engaged with others around you. Even your laughter had a way of drawing me in. Something about your energy felt genuine, comforting, and unexpectedly uplifting. :3

I soon realized that it was not just your presence, but the way you made me feel comfortable. I could be myself around you, without masks, without pretense. I could share my thoughts, worries, and even my insecurities, and I never felt judged. That sense of emotional safety is really rare, and it made me begin to trust you in ways I had not trusted anyone in a long time.

Your personality is unique and multifaceted. You're at once kind and thoughtful, funny and expressive, serious and reflective. Being around you, I began to appreciate these qualities and how naturally they fit together. It wasn't overwhelming, nor was it flashy, it was simply genuine, and it resonated with me deeplyyy.

Another reason I chose you is the connection we share. It’s hard to describe, but it's as if we operate on the same wavelength. We understand each other without much effort, sometimes even without words. That sense of alignment, of shared perspective, is INCREDIBLY rare, and it made me feel that being with you would be effortless in the most meaningful way.

There is also the thoughtfulness you show in the little things. The way you notice small details about people, the way you offer help without expecting anything in return, and the way you respond thoughtfully to what I say; all of this revealed to me a depth of character that I deeply admire.

I cannot overstate how safe I feel with you, both emotionally and mentally. I can express my thoughts freely, my doubts, and even my irrational fears, and still feel accepted. That kind of acceptance is not something I give lightly, and it speaks volumes about your empathy and understanding. 😸

Your presence has inspired me to be more patient, more reflective, and more considerate, not because you demand it, but simply because your example encourages it. You have this subtle influence that motivates me to be a better version of myself, without pressure or expectation.

It is also the combination of all these qualities that makes you unforgettable. Your kindness, your humor, your attentiveness, your reliability, and the way you make everything feel lighter when you're around; all of these contribute to why I chose you :3.

Choosing you was not about a single moment, a single gesture, or a single quality. It was about the sum of everything I have observed, felt, and appreciated over time. It is about how your personality, your energy, and your presence align with who I am and what I value in a connection.

I chose you because being with you feels natural. It feels like an alignment of paths that were meant to intersect, something that I had not expected to find again. It's a choice that's both reasoned and instinctive, thoughtful yet undeniable.

I chose you because, despite my fears and hesitations, my heart recognized something in you that it hadn't recognized before. A sense of safety, comfort, and belonging that I had been longing for a long time without realizing it.

Ultimately, I chose you because you make life feel lighter and brighter simply by being yourself :). You have a way of making the ordinary extraordinary, the mundane memorable, and the difficult bearable. Being around you reminds me that connection, trust, and genuine care are still possible.

So yes, I chose you, not lightly, not impulsively, and not without thought. I chose you for the way you make me feel, for the way we connect, and for the person you are. And every day, as I reflect on it, I am grateful that I did. o((>ω< ))o`

subtitle: "Little Things You Do",
content: `
It’s amazing how the little things you do mean so much. Things that might seem ordinary to anyone else, but sa ako, they’re everything. Like the way you approach me just to say hi, even when busy or tired ka. It’s such a simple gesture, but it makes me feel seen and remembered, and yes, it makes my day. 

I love how you check up on me, even for the smallest reasons. When you notice I’m quiet or a little off, and you ask if I’m okay, it feels like you genuinely care. It’s not forced, not an obligation, it’s you being you, noticing me, and that means more than I can explain.

Then there’s the way you always think of little comforts. Giving me snacks or water, or reminding me to eat, drink, or take care of myself. It’s such a simple thing, but it tells me that you pay attention to me, that you care enough to act, and that's just so really, really sweet of you.

And it’s not just the gestures, it’s the thought behind them. Helping me carry stuff when my hands are full, assisting me with small tasks, or even just being around to help me navigate daily things, it makes me feel supported in ways I didn’t even realize I needed. You make the little challenges feel lighter, simply by being there.

There’s also your lambing side, the affectionate, playful, and loving way you express yourself. When you’re sweet, teasing, or just being gentle with me, I can’t help but smile. It’s the kind of warmth that makes me feel safe, happy, and cared for, all at once.

Even when I try to brush it off or convince myself it’s nothing, I catch myself remembering these moments, the small acts of kindness, the gentle touches, the laughs we share. They’re not just fleeting moments; they’re memories that linger with me.

I notice the patterns, too. How you do these things naturally, without expecting anything in return. You don’t have to be thoughtful, but you are, every time. That authenticity makes it all the more special. It shows me the kind of person you are; kind, considerate, loving, and genuine.

One of the things that amazes me the most is the way you actively want to be better for us. Everything you do, every effort you make, it’s because you believe I deserve it. You don’t just act out of habit or expectation; you act because you care about me, and that thoughtfulness makes me melts every time.

The little things also show just how well we click. The way you seem to know exactly when I need a joke, some space, or just someone to quietly be there with me. Being around you feels effortless, like we just understand each other without trying, and it’s a feeling I can’t quite put into words.

It’s also how you make the ordinary feel extraordinary. Something as simple as sharing a snack, walking together, or chatting about random stuff suddenly becomes special kay it’s with you. Every small moment carries weight, warmth, and meaning for me :3.

Even the way you support me emotionally stands out. When I doubt myself or feel confused, you’re patient. You listen, encourage, and remind me of my worth without making me feel pressured. Your support isn’t loud or dramatic, it’s quiet, consistent, and incredibly grounding.

And then there are the unspoken things, the tiny gestures that I might not mention but notice anyway. A glance, a smile, the way you remember a small preference I mentioned once, or how you make me laugh even on my worst days. It all adds up, building this undeniable feeling that you care more than you realize.

It’s these little things, small, thoughtful, genuine, that slowly made me realize how much I value you. How much I cherish having you around. How much I fall, bit by bit, for not just who you are, but the way you make me feel. And knowing that you do all of this because you want to be better for us, because you believe I deserve it, it hits differently.

Honestly, I think it’s these moments, every laugh, every gesture, every act of care, that make me fall for you over and over. Every little thing you do is a reflection of who you are, and why I love being with you. And I hope you know na it doesn’t go unnoticed. Every single thing you do is appreciated, treasured, and remembered.`

subtitle: "On Your Tough Days",
content: `
I know that even the strongest people have tough days. Even you.

On those days, I notice. You talk less than usual, your energy feels low, and I can see the sadness in your eyes. I notice even when you try to hide it.

I know that some of what you carry comes from things at home, things you can’t tell me, things you have to handle alone. I see it, even when you don’t say anything.

It’s okay to feel tired or overwhelmed. It doesn’t make you weak. It makes you human.

You don’t always have to carry everything by yourself. It’s okay to lean on someone who cares.

I want to be here for you, not to solve everything, but to remind you that you’re not alone. That someone is rooting for you, always.

Sometimes, it’s enough to just sit quietly with you, to let you know I’m here. To offer my presence without words, without pressure.

Even when you try to stay strong for others, I notice the effort you make. I notice how much you still care, how you still try, even when it’s hard.

It’s okay to feel sad, to have moments where you feel down. Those feelings are valid. They don’t define you, they’re just part of your journey :>.

I hope you remember that every small step you take, even on the hardest days, is progress. Every time you keep going is proof of your strength.

I notice the little things, too, the way you push yourself, the quiet moments when you keep your head up, the small ways you try to take care of yourself. It’s inspiring.

Even when you don’t talk about what’s on your mind, I want you to know I see you. I notice the weight you carry, and I care about it deeply.

On your tough days, it’s okay to rest, to pause, and to take things slowly. You don’t always have to have all the answers.

I hope you let yourself feel, let yourself breathe, and let yourself heal. I’ll be here through it allll, listening, supporting, or just being present.

Because even on the hardest days, you are strong, capable, and loved. You’re doing your best, and that is enough. And I’ll always be here to remind you of that. Ψ(￣∀￣)Ψ`

subtitle: "On Your Bright Days",
content: `
On your bright days, I notice how alive you are. Your energy fills the room, and it’s impossible not to smile when I see you genuinely happy. The way you carry yourself, light-hearted yet confident, makes everything around you feel lighter too :>.

I’m sooo proud of how hard you try every day, even when things get tough. Your effort, consistency, and determination never go unnoticed. Watching you push through challenges inspires me more than I can express. It reminds me that perseverance is something truly admirable.

You’re amazing at academics, and I can see how much work you put into everything you do. Your dedication shows not just in your grades, but in the way you approach learning and growth. Seeing your successes makes me believe even more in your potential. You motivate me to aim higher too, just by being yourself.

Your family clearly loves and values you, and I understand why, they’re lucky to have someone so thoughtful, capable, and caring. That love and support shines through in everything you do. It makes me admire the bond you share with them. Knowing they see your worth as much as I do is comforting and heartwarming.

Even when you’re at your happiest, I notice the way you care for those around you. The smiles you share, the attention you give, the way you lift others effortlessly, it’s remarkable. You make people feel valued without trying, just by being kind and present. That thoughtfulness is one of the many reasons I admire you.

You have a quiet confidence that doesn’t need to show off. It’s calm, genuine, and inspiring. People naturally trust and respect you because of it. Your presence reassures those around you, making everything feel steadier and warmer.

Your joy is contagious. When you’re laughing, joking, or genuinely enjoying something, it spreads to anyone nearby, you might not notice it, but I do. Ordinary moments suddenly feel special simply because you’re part of them. Your energy reminds me how much happiness can impact people quietly but powerfully.

I admire your character; your kindness, humility, and thoughtfulness. You do the right thing not for recognition, but because it’s simply who you are. That integrity makes me proud to know you. It’s inspiring to see someone live with such balance and purpose.

I hope you feel proud of yourself too. Your wins, big or small, are proof of your dedication and effort. Every goal you reach, every challenge you overcome, deserves celebration. You should never doubt how capable and resilient you are.

I notice the way you balance things like; school, responsibilities, family, and relationships, while still being someone others can rely on. That’s not easy, yet you make it seem natural. Your strength and composure inspire me to handle my own life with more grace. You’re a reminder that balance is possible even under pressure :3.

Seeing you grow, learn, and push yourself to be better is one of the most uplifting things. You’re constantly becoming an even stronger, more inspiring person. That growth, both seen and unseen, is something to be proud of. I feel lucky to witness it every day.

I admire how you remain true to yourself while striving to improve. That balance between authenticity and ambition is rare. It’s one of the things that makes you uniquely you. And it’s one of the many reasons I feel drawn to you.

Your happiness makes me happy too. Every laugh, every smile, every small moment of joy reminds me how lucky I am to have you in my life. Seeing you shine encourages me to cherish the good moments as much as I can. You make life feel brighter just by being in it.

I hope you never underestimate yourself. You’re more capable than you realize, and the dedication, growth, and effort you put into everything is something to truly be proud of. You deserve every bit of recognition, love, and happiness that comes your way.

Even in the simplest moments, your effort, your care, and your heart turn them into something meaningful. The way you live, care, and love makes life feel richer and fuller. That’s why I treasure your bright days soo muchh.

Through it all, I want you to know: I see you, I appreciate you, and I’m proud of you, not just for what you do, but for who you are. Your presence, your kindness, and your light make such a difference, and I’ll always celebrate that.`

subtitle: "What You’ve Taught Me",
content: `
Life with you has taught me that learning isn’t only from books or school. It’s in the quiet moments, the conversations we share, and the way you make me feel seen. I’ve realized that lessons come in many forms, and sometimes the most important ones are about myself. Being around you has opened my eyes to that.

I’ve realized that I’m easy to love, and that someone can care for me genuinely, without conditions. You’ve shown me that love can be simple, steady, and sincere. Accepting care and affection doesn’t make me weak, it makes me human. I finally see how worth it it is to let someone in.

Seeing myself through your eyes has given me a new perspective. I notice my strengths and flaws in a gentler and kinder light. It helps me reflect on my choices and feelings without being harsh. You’ve helped me grow in self-awareness in a way I didn’t expect.

I’ve learned that different perspectives really matter, just by watching how you see life. Not every problem has one right answer, and not every opinion is final. Because of you, I try to be more understanding and seeing things from other people’s point of view has always been a part of me, but you’ve helped me do it more gently and thoughtfully.

Patience has become clearer to me since I met you. It’s okay to take my time, to make mistakes, and to stumble without fear. Growth isn’t instant, and that’s perfectly normal. Your example reminds me that persistence matters more than perfection.

Supporting someone doesn’t mean changing them. Encouragement, listening, and gentle guidance can make a bigger impact than force or pressure. I’ve learned that helping others means lifting them up while letting them remain themselves. That’s a lesson I’ll carry forever.

Love can be found in the little things, and I see it in everything you do. Whether it’s bringing snacks, checking in, or making me laugh, every small act shows you care. It’s the everyday consistency that matters more than big gestures. I’ve learned to appreciate how love can quietly shine.

Celebrating small victories has become important to me. Each success, no matter how minor, deserves recognition. You’ve helped me see progress in every step forward. That mindset changes how I approach challenges and setbacks.

Communication is more than just speaking; it’s also listening and understanding. I’ve learned to share my thoughts and frustrations openly. You’ve made me feel that expressing myself isn’t a burden. That has strengthened our connection.

Trust doesn’t come easily, but you’ve shown me that it can grow naturally. Opening up to someone can feel safe when care is genuine. I’ve learned that trust is built through small, consistent actions. That lesson has changed how I connect with people.

Effort matters more than perfection, and I’ve seen that so clearly in you. It’s not the rare or grand gestures that stand out, but the daily acts of care, attention, and thoughtfulness you put into everything you do. I notice the little things; the way you remember small details, check in, or quietly support those around you, and I truly cherish each one. Your consistency and sincerity show me how meaningful love and care can be in the everyday.

Life can be viewed more positively, and you’ve helped me see that. Small moments, challenges, and ordinary days all carry meaning if approached with thoughtfulness. I feel more empathetic and hopeful because of your example. It changes the way I live each day.

Being with you has taught me how important it is to give attention to the people we care about. I notice the little ways you show love, and it makes me want to treasure every moment we share even more. Your support, thoughtfulness, and care make everything between us feel deeper and more meaningful.

Most of all, you’ve shown me that love doesn’t have to be complicated to be real. With you, it’s simple, genuine, and fulfilling. Letting you care for me doesn’t make me weak, it makes me feel safe, seen, and loved in a way I never imagined. Being with you has made vulnerability feel beautiful, and I will always be grateful for that.`

Why I Feel at Home With You

I feel at home with you because being with you never feels forced. I don’t have to pretend, impress, or constantly explain myself. I can just exist as I am, and that alone makes me feel safe.

There’s comfort in the way you listen. You don’t rush me, don’t judge my thoughts, and don’t make me feel small for feeling the way I do. Even in silence, I feel understood.

With you, my guard comes down naturally. I don’t feel the need to overthink my words or hide parts of myself. You accept me in moments when I’m loud, quiet, emotional, or unsure, and that acceptance means everything to me.

You make ordinary moments feel peaceful. Whether we’re talking, laughing, or just sitting together, there’s a sense of calm I don’t find anywhere else. It’s the kind of calm that makes me feel grounded.

I feel at home with you because you make space for my emotions. You let me feel without making me feel like a burden. You remind me that my feelings matter, even when they’re messy or hard to explain.

There’s something reassuring about knowing I can turn to you after a long day. Your presence feels familiar in the best way, like something I’ve known for a long time, even when everything else feels overwhelming.

Being with you feels like rest. Not the kind where everything disappears, but the kind where I don’t have to carry everything alone. You make life feel lighter just by being there.

I feel safe enough with you to be vulnerable. To share my worries, my dreams, and even my fears. That trust didn’t happen overnight, but it grew naturally, and now it feels steady and real.

You make me feel seen. Not just in my good moments, but in my tired ones too. You notice the little changes in me, and that makes me feel cared for in a way that’s quiet but deep.

Home isn’t always a place. Sometimes, it’s a person. And with you, I’ve found a sense of belonging that feels warm, steady, and real. That’s why I feel at home with you.`

subtitle: "The Moments Only We Get",
content: `
There are moments we share that no one else really sees. Small, quiet moments that might look ordinary from the outside, but feel special to us. They’re the kind of moments that only happen when two people understand each other deeply. Moments that are ours alone, even if they go unnoticed by everyone else.

I love the way our conversations flow, even when they start as nonsense, HAHA. One minute we’re laughing at something silly, and the next we’re sharing thoughts we don’t tell anyone else. That shift, that comfort, makes me feel closer to you than words can describe.

There’s a quiet comfort in our silences. No one needs to fill them, no one needs to force them. Just being together, side by side, is enough. Those moments feel like home.

I notice the little things; your tiny glances, soft smiles, subtle touches, that might seem small to anyone else but mean everything to me. The way you raise an eyebrow, that playful smirk, your high-pitched voice, the way you look at me like you have your own private way of seeing me haha keleg ror, even the way you kiss my hand, it all speaks a language only we understand, louder than any words could ever be.

Sometimes we’re just sitting together doing nothing, yet it feels like the world has paused for us. It’s a rare feeling, that peace and calm, when nothing else matters except this moment. And I never want to forget it.

I treasure the times when one of us checks in unexpectedly. A text, a soft “are you okay?”, a small gesture of care. Those little moments remind me that even in chaos, we see each other. They remind me that I’m not alone.

There are moments when we’re tired or stressed, yet we still choose to spend time together. Even when the day is heavy, being with you feels like a relief, like a soft reset. That consistency, that choice, makes me appreciate us even more.

I love our playful moments, the inside jokes, the teasing, the laughter that comes so naturally. It’s in those times that I see how effortless it is for us to be ourselves. We don’t have to pretend; we just exist in our shared world.

Sometimes it’s serious too. Deep conversations about hopes, fears, and dreams that we don’t share with anyone else. Those moments of honesty and vulnerability make our bond stronger.

There are random moments where one glance or a smile says everything. No words are needed. You understand me, and I understand you. Those moments are ours alone, private, and priceless.

I love the small routines we’ve created, the habits only we know. The way we naturally fall into rhythm, finishing each other’s sentences, understanding the unspoken cues. Those little things make me feel connected to you in a way nothing else can.

Even when we’re busy or distracted, the little moments we have together feel so special. You pinching my cheek, being playful and touchy, or holding my hand for just a moment—these small things become memories I treasure deeply.

Sometimes we comfort each other without words. A hug when one of us is in a bad mood, feeling gloomy, or sick, a gentle squeeze of the hand, or just sitting close together, these moments say more than anything we could ever say out loud.

Sometimes we get silly together, acting goofy, laughing at nothing, just enjoying the freedom of being ourselves. There’s a joy in those moments that feels uncontainable, like the world fades and it’s only us.

I love how being with you turns the usual into something I truly treasure. Long talks that stretch into laughter, our quiet moments just sharing space, or the way we can spend hours together doing nothing and it still feels special, everything becomes meaningful because of you. You make normal days feel unforgettable.

These moments, small or big, quiet or loud, are ours. They’re the ones I carry in my heart, the ones I replay in my mind when we’re apart. They’re reminders that we have something rare (mythical), something real, and something only WE, yes, just us, get to share.

And that’s why I cherish every single one of them. The moments we only get, with you, make life feel fuller, warmer, and infinitely better. Every day feels richer and sweeter, simply by being you.`

subtitle: "What I Admire About You",
content: `
What I admire most about you is the way you keep trying, even when things aren’t easy. You don’t give up when things get heavy; you push through quietly, without needing praise or attention. That kind of strength is rare, and it says so much about who you are.

I admire your dedication to your responsibilities. Whether it’s academics, family, or the people you care about, you take everything seriously. You don’t do things halfway, and your effort shows in everything you accomplish. :>

Your intelligence is something I deeply admire, not just because you’re smart, but because of how you use it. You’re curious, thoughtful, and willing to learn. You don’t look down on others, and you’re always patient when helping someone understand.

There’s a kindness in you that feels genuine and effortless. You help without expecting anything in return, and you care without making a show out of it. The way you look out for others, even in small ways, says a lot about your heart.

I admire your humility. Despite everything you’re capable of, you remain grounded. You don’t feel the need to prove yourself to anyone, and that quiet confidence makes you even more admirable.

Your emotional strength stands out to me. You carry so much, yet you still choose to show up for others. Even when you’re tired or overwhelmed, you find ways to care, and that takes so much inner strength.

I admire the way you listen. You’re present, attentive, and sincere. When someone talks to you, they feel heard, and that’s a gift not everyone has.

Your willingness to grow is something I truly respect. You don’t see mistakes as failures, but as chances to learn and become better. That mindset makes you someone who will continue to grow no matter where life takes you.

I admire how you treat people with respect, regardless of who they are or what they can offer. Your kindness isn’t selective; it’s consistent. That speaks a lot about your character.

There’s something comforting about your presence. You don’t need to say much or do anything grand to make people feel at ease. Just being around you feels steady and reassuring.

I admire how responsible you are. You take care of the things that matter, remembering the little details, keeping your word, and looking out for the people you care about.

I admire your resilience. No matter what challenges come your way, you keep going, and you don’t let difficulties make you cold, if anything, they make you more understanding.

subtitle: "When I Miss You",
content: `
When I miss you, it comes quietly at first. It sneaks into my thoughts when I least expect it. A small reminder, a passing memory, or something that feels familiar suddenly makes my chest feel heavy. That’s when I realize how much space you take in my heart.

Sometimes, missing you feels like a pause in the day. Everything keeps moving, but I slow down just a little. My mind drifts to you without effort, like it already knows where it wants to go hahsdha. You become the thought I return to again and againnn.

I miss the sound of your voice more than I admit. Even simple conversations feel special when they’re with you. When I miss you, I replay moments in my head just to feel close again. It’s my way of holding onto you from afar.

There are moments when I wish I could tell you everything I’m thinking right then and there. The small thoughts, the random feelings, the things that don’t feel important until you’re not around. Missing you makes me realize how much I want to share my life with you. Even the simple parts feel incomplete without you.

When I miss you, time feels different. Minutes feel longer, and waiting feels heavier. I find myself checking my phone more often than usual. Just the thought of hearing from you brings comfort.

I miss the way being with you feels effortless. No pressure, no pretending, just comfort and familiarity. When you’re not around, I notice the absence of that ease. It reminds me how rare that feeling is.

Sometimes missing you feels warm instead of sad. It’s filled with memories that make me smile without realizing it. Even though there’s distance, the connection still feels strong. That thought brings me peace.

There are days when I miss you in the smallest ways. I miss the little habits, the shared jokes, and the quiet moments. Those tiny things stay with me longer than I expect. They linger because they matter.

When I miss you, I think about how safe I feel with you. That sense of comfort doesn’t disappear just because you’re not here. It stays with me, like something steady I can rely on. And that makes missing you feel bearable.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if you were right beside me. The things we’d talk about, or maybe the silence we’d share. Those thoughts make the distance feel smaller. They remind me that this feeling comes from something real.

I miss you in moments of happiness too. When something good happens, you’re the first person I want to tell. Missing you then feels like a quiet longing to share joy. It’s another reminder of how much you mean to me.

When I miss you, I remind myself that this feeling exists because of connection. Because caring this deeply means something real is there. It’s not just longing, it’s proof of love and attachment. That thought gives the feeling meaning.

There are times when missing you makes me emotional. It hits suddenly and without warning. But even then, I wouldn’t trade this feeling for indifference. Missing you means you matter deeply to me.

I miss you in ways that are hard to explain. Not just your presence, but the way you make things feel lighter. Life feels softer when you’re around. That’s what I long for when you’re not.

Even when the distance feels heavy, I hold onto patience. I remind myself that this isn’t forever. Missing you makes seeing you again feel even more special. It gives me something to look forward to.

When I miss you, I hold onto the certainty that you’re worth it. Every longing moment, every quiet ache, every thought of you. You’re worth missing, every single time. And I’d choose this feeling again if it meant choosing you.`

subtitle: "How You Changed Me",
content: `
You’ve changed me in ways I didn’t even realize until now. I feel softer, more patient, and more understanding because of you. You’ve taught me to see the good in small things, and to appreciate quiet moments. Life feels different with you in it, richer, warmer, and calmer.

I’ve learned to trust more openly. I no longer hesitate to share my thoughts or feelings, even the messy ones. You’ve shown me that being vulnerable doesn’t make me weak. That lesson has shifted the way I connect with everyone, not just you.

You’ve changed how I view love. I used to think it was complicated, heavy, or exhausting. Being with you makes it feel natural, simple, and joyful :3. Loving you feels instinctive, something I don’t have to think about.

I’ve started noticing the little details that make life beautiful. The way sunlight shines, the way laughter spreads, the way small gestures matter more than grand ones. You’ve taught me to find joy in these small things. And because of you, I appreciate life more fully.

I’ve learned patience because of you. Waiting for messages, understanding you, and giving you space has taught me how to slow down. I’ve realized not everything has to happen immediately. Timing, effort, and care all matter, and that’s a lesson I owe to you.

You’ve taught me empathy. I try harder to understand perspectives that aren’t my own. I listen more attentively, think before reacting, and consider feelings beyond my own. That growth wouldn’t have been possible without seeing your compassion in action.

You’ve helped me appreciate consistency. The little things you do every day, without expecting attention, show me that love and care are in the details. Actions matter more than words. That lesson has changed the way I act, not just in love, but in life.

I’ve learned to slow down and enjoy the moment. With you, it’s never about rushing or forcing things. Every shared laugh, every quiet glance, every touch is meaningful. I’ve realized the importance of presence, and that’s because of you.

You’ve changed how I view happiness. I used to think it was tied to achievements or milestones. Now I see that joy can be as simple as a text from you or sitting next to you in silence. You’ve redefined what it means to feel truly happy.

I’ve grown more confident because of you. Your encouragement, your trust, and your belief in me make me believe in myself. Even on bad days, your presence reminds me that I’m capable. That confidence is a gift I carry with me every day :>.

You’ve taught me to celebrate small wins. I notice the little improvements, the progress, the effort, it’s made me more optimistic. Life feels brighter when I acknowledge the journey, not just the destination. That perspective is something I’ve learned from watching you live with intention.

I’ve learned to be kinder to myself. You never judge my flaws or mistakes; instead, you encourage me to grow. I’ve learned to forgive myself, to treat myself with patience, and to see my own worth. That shift has made me more balanced and happier.

You’ve shown me the power of listening. Not just hearing words, but truly understanding what someone is feeling. That skill has helped me in every relationship I have. It’s changed the way I connect with people.

You’ve changed how I see love. I used to think it was only shown through big gestures, but now I know it’s in small acts, thoughtfulness, and the moments we share. Loving you has taught me that what’s felt matters more than what’s shown.

You’ve taught me gratitude. I notice little things, moments of joy, and people’s efforts in ways I didn’t before. Life feels fuller and richer because I’m more mindful of these gifts. That awareness is something I cherish deeply.

I’ve learned resilience. Seeing how you handle challenges quietly and steadily has inspired me to be stronger. I approach setbacks with a calmer mind, knowing effort matters more than frustration. That strength is part of the change you’ve brought into me.

You’ve made me more appreciative of time. Moments with you feel valuable, fleeting, and precious. I’ve learned to savor them, to notice them, and to hold them close. That mindset is something I'll always carry with me :)

Finally, you’ve changed me by showing me love’s simplicity. It’s not dramatic or exhausting, it’s steady, comforting, and real. I feel lighter, happier, and more complete because of you. And that, above all, is what I admire most.`

I promise to comfort you when I can. I may not always have solutions, but I can offer care and presence. Sometimes just being there is enough. I want to be someone you feel safe with.

I promise to communicate when something weighs on me. Instead of pulling away, I’ll try to express myself. It won’t always be easy, but I want to try. Understanding matters more than silence.

I promise to keep things light when they need to be. To laugh with you, joke around, and enjoy the fun moments. Love shouldn’t always feel heavy. I want it to feel warm and alive too.

I promise to acknowledge my mistakes. When I get things wrong, I’ll own up to them and learn. Growth comes from accountability, and I’m willing to do that. I don’t want pride to get in the way of us.

I promise to encourage you when you doubt yourself. I’ll remind you of your strengths and the effort you put in. Even if you don’t see it yet, I do. That belief is something I can offer sincerely.

subtitle: "The Things I Fear Losing",
content: `
There are things about us that I hold very close, and one of them is the safety you give me. Your presence has a way of calming me, even on busy or overwhelming days. Just knowing you’re there brings comfort. I can’t imagine not having that :<.

I also treasure the routines we’ve built without even noticing. The messages, the laughter, the random jokes that slip into the day. They seem small, but they brighten everything. Losing those quiet constants would leave an emptiness I’d feel right away.

The silence we share means more to me than words. Sitting together without needing to talk feels rare and special. Those moments are simple, but they carry warmth. They’re something I never want to take for granted.

What we understand without explaining is something I value deeply. The looks, the inside jokes, the knowing smiles all create a connection that feels natural. It’s not something that can be replaced easily. Losing that would hurt in ways words can’t explain.

Trust is another thing I protect closely. Being able to open up, share fears, and speak honestly took time to build. That safety means everything to me. The thought of losing it feels heavy.

Your laughter brings light into my days. The jokes, the teasing, the silly moments make life feel lighter. That kind of joy is rare. Without it, days would feel quieter and less alive.

The support we give each other matters more than I often say. Your encouragement and kind words make hard days easier. They remind me I’m not facing things alone. Life feels heavier without that kind of support.

Even the warmth in small touches means a lot to me. Holding hands, hugs, and casual touches remind me of closeness. They’re simple but grounding. Without them, days would feel colder.

I value how honest we are with each other. Sharing thoughts without fear creates comfort and trust. That openness makes communication easy. Losing it would make everything feel distant.

The fun we share adds color to life. Playful arguments, games, and spontaneous moments turn into memories I keep. They make ordinary days brighter. Without them, things would feel dull.

I notice the quiet care you show. Checking in, asking how I am, offering help without being asked. Those gestures make me feel seen and valued. They’re not loud, but they matter.

You also inspire me in ways you might not realize. Your effort and growth push me to do better. Watching you try encourages me daily. Losing that motivation would leave a gap.

The small words you say stay with me. Simple reassurances carry more weight than you think. They settle in my heart and stay there. Without them, comfort would feel harder to find.

Facing difficult days together makes everything easier. Patience, understanding, and quiet support help me feel steady. Those moments matter during the hardest times. Losing that would leave me feeling alone.

I hold onto the certainty that we still care, even through distance or disagreement. Knowing we choose each other through ups and downs gives me peace. That trust strengthens us. Without it, everything would feel uncertain.

Our shared dreams give me something to look forward to. Hopes, plans, and little wishes make life feel exciting. Sharing them makes me feel connected to you. Losing that would make things feel far apart.

Even the way we make simple days feel meaningful matters to me. A snack, a walk, or a short conversation can feel special with you. Those moments stay with me long after. They remind me why I care so deeply.

Being understood is something I never want to lose. That feeling of being seen without having to explain everything brings comfort. It makes me feel safe and accepted. Losing that would make me feel unseen.

The joy we create together is something I protect closely. The laughter, teasing, and shared happiness fill my days. Those memories are precious to me. Without them, life would feel emptier.

I think about change, distance, and time, and how they can slowly shift things. Even small changes in closeness matter to me. That fear exists because of how much you mean to me. It reminds me to cherish what we have, every single day.`

subtitle: "For When You Doubt Yourself",
content: `
It’s okay to feel uncertain sometimes, Sam. Everyone has moments where they question themselves or their choices. That doesn’t mean you’re failing or weak. Those doubts are just part of being human :). 

I want you to remember how capable you really are. Even when things feel hard, you’ve overcome challenges before. You have the strength and skill to handle what comes next. Trust yourself, even if it feels scary.

There will be days when you feel small or overlooked. On those days, know that your effort matters. Even tiny steps show progress and growth. You’re doing more than you realize.

It’s natural to compare yourself to others. But your journey is yours alone. Your pace, your choices, your strengths; they’re unique. Don’t let comparisons steal your confidence, omkiee?

You’ve faced obstacles before and survived. That resilience hasn’t disappeared. It’s part of who you are, quietly guiding you through challenges. Believe in that strength when doubt creeps in :>

Sometimes, your mind may focus on mistakes or setbacks. Instead of letting them define you, see them as lessons. Every misstep teaches something valuable. You’re learning and growing every day.

I hope you remember the people who care for you. Those who see your heart, your effort, and your kindness. They notice you even when you feel invisible. Lean on them when doubt feels heavy.

There are qualities in you that are rare and special. Your kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, and humor matter. You inspire and uplift those around you. Don’t underestimate the power you already hold.

You don’t have to have all the answers right now. Life is a series of questions and learning as you go. It’s okay to take things one step at a time. That doesn’t make you any less capable.

Even when progress feels slow, it’s still progress. Every effort, every decision, every attempt matters. Celebrate the small wins, they build the foundation for bigger ones. You’re moving forward more than you see.

Remember that feelings of doubt don’t make you flawed. They are temporary, and they do not define your abilities. You are capable, resilient, and worthy. Keep focusing on the strengths you already have.

You’ve made it through tough times before. That proves that you can handle more than you sometimes believe. Your strength is quietly constant, even when you feel unsure. Trust that it’s enough.

Sometimes, taking a break is necessary. Resting doesn’t mean giving up. It means you care for yourself and your well-being. Come back to challenges refreshed and stronger.

Focus on the things you can control. Worrying about the rest only adds unnecessary stress. Your choices, effort, and attitude matter most. Use them wisely and intentionally.

Celebrate who you are right now. You’re growing, learning, and improving every day. Even imperfections are part of your beauty. Don’t let doubt hide your worth.

You are more resilient than you think. Challenges test you, but they also show your capacity to endure. Every time you keep going, you prove your strength. Believe in that even when it’s hard to see.

It’s okay to feel unsure about the future. No one has it all figured out, not even adults. What matters is the effort you put in and the heart you show. That effort is enough for today.

Try to focus on what you’ve achieved, not what feels out of reach. Every small victory, every skill learned, every act of care counts. You’ve accomplished more than you realize. Take pride in that :D. 

Above all, remember that I believe in you. Even when you doubt yourself, I see your effort, your growth, and your heart. You are capable, strong, and loved. Let that belief lift you when you feel uncertain.`

subtitle: "What I Want You to Know",
content: `
Sometimes it annoyed me when it felt like you didn’t come closer when I needed you. Even small moments, like when I reached out, it seemed like you weren’t sure how to respond. Being called “desperate” for caring made me overthink even more and feel a little hurt. I just wished you noticed and reached back, even in a small way, because it mattered to me.

There were times I felt left wondering about your thoughts or feelings. Not knowing where we stood made me anxious and overanalyze everything. I know you didn’t mean to make me feel that way, but I want you to understand how confusing it was for me. A little clarity or reassurance would have gone a long way.

It used to bother me when it seemed like I was the only one making an effort. Little gestures, messages, or check-ins sometimes felt one-sided, and it made me question if I mattered as much to you at that moment. I understand now that it wasn’t intentional, but I want to be honest about how it felt for me.

Sometimes I wish there was more openness between us in those moments. Even small hints or simple words could have made me feel safer and more understood. A little communication could have avoided a lot of confusion and worry, and I hope we can both work on that moving forward.

I also want to say that sometimes I held back my feelings because I didn’t want to pressure you or make things awkward. I know that may have added to the distance, and I regret letting my worries pile up instead of sharing them sooner.

Even though it annoyed me at the time, I understand more now. I see how things might have seemed complicated from your side too. I just hope you truly know what I felt back then. Those small or silent moments mattered to me a lot.

And now, it’s okay. Those little annoyances belong to the past, and they don’t define us. I hope we don’t go back to those moments, but if ever they happen again, like unnecessary distance or misunderstandings, I trust that we can communicate and handle it together instead of letting it grow :>.`

content: `
Silence between us can feel heavy sometimes. I notice the quiet moments and start wondering what you’re thinking. Even if it’s nothing serious, my mind starts overthinking, and I wish I could feel closer to you, even in the quiet.

Not talking makes me miss the little things about you; your jokes, your teasing, your voice. I realize how much I take those moments for granted, and it makes me appreciate you more when we finally do speak.

Sometimes I worry that you’re upset or distant. Even if you’re not, my mind fills the gaps. I know it’s not fair to you, but I want you to know how I feel. I want us to stay connected, even when we’re apart, and I hope you can be brave enough to share what’s on your mind with me, even if it feels hard.

I remember during the 2nd quarter exams, I was really hurting. I felt distant from you and unsure of where we stood. I was glad I made the move first to ask you to talk, but it was draining when it felt like I was always the one to reach out. It meant a lot to me, and I hope you felt how much I wanted us to understand each other. I hope you get me, even when I don’t say everything perfectly.

I feel a little lost when we go long stretches without talking. The bond we share feels quieter, almost paused. I know silence doesn’t mean we’re drifting, but it can make me anxious. I hope we can notice each other sooner and reach out before the pause grows too long.

Even when we don’t talk, I hope you know I care. My thoughts are still with you, and I wish I could reach out without feeling awkward. A small message, even just a “hi,” would mean a lot. I hope we can do that more naturally.

I notice how much I rely on our daily interactions, whether in chat or in person. Little updates, random stories, or simple moments together make me feel close to you. When they don’t happen, I realize how important those moments are. I understand we don’t need to interact every day, but I hope we can keep that closeness alive whenever we can.

Sometimes I get anxious when you wait too long to respond. I know you also want to fix things, but the delay makes the hurt feel bigger. I hope we can talk sooner, share our thoughts, and work through moments together, so neither of us feels left alone.

Even without words, I notice the small things you do—your presence, a glance, a smile. They reassure me and show me that we still care. I wish we could be more aware of each other in those quiet times, so the silence feels comforting rather than lonely.

I miss your voice the most when we don’t talk. Just hearing you makes everything lighter and easier. That’s why even short conversations or small check-ins mean so much to me.

I try to trust that distance doesn’t mean we’re disconnected. Even in quiet moments, I keep you in my thoughts. I hope you feel the same, so we can still feel close even when we’re apart.

I wish silence could help us grow closer, not create worry. Understanding each other without words is something I hope we practice together. It takes patience and care, but I believe we can do it.

Even when I feel anxious in silence, I remind myself that love isn’t only in words. It’s in care, trust, and small gestures. I hope we always find ways to show that, so quiet moments don’t feel empty.

Sometimes I imagine what you’re doing during our quiet moments. Thinking about you keeps me close, even when we’re apart. I know silence is temporary. It doesn’t erase what we have.

I hope we can be brave enough to talk to each other, even when it feels uncomfortable. Sharing fears, doubts, or small worries won’t push me away—it will bring us closer. I want us to feel safe opening up fully.

Sometimes silence teaches me to appreciate words more. Every “hi,” every laugh, every conversation becomes precious. I notice them more after quiet, and it makes me value our connection deeply.

Even when we don’t talk, I carry you in my thoughts. It’s a quiet kind of presence, but it’s there. I hope you feel the same about me. That makes the wait easier.

And in the end, I remind myself that it’s okay when we don’t talk sometimes. Distance or quiet moments are natural, but I hope we never let them linger too long. If it happens again, I hope we both remember to reach out and communicate, and I trust we’ll handle it together.`

Sometimes I struggle to put my thoughts into words. It’s not because I don’t trust you, but because I fear they might sound too much. My thoughts pile up, and I don’t know where to start. I hope you understand that silence doesn’t mean I don’t care.

I often wish I could tell you how proud I am of you. You try so hard, and sometimes I just want to shout it out. But I keep it in, thinking you already know. I hope you can feel it even without words.

There are moments when I miss your presence more than I can explain. It’s not just about being together, it’s how you make everything feel lighter. Even if I don’t say it, you’re in my thoughts, my small gestures try to show it.

Sometimes fear keeps me from sharing my worries. Thoughts about the future, about us, or about myself feel too big to voice. I don’t want to burden you with them. I hope you trust that I’m doing my best quietly.

The little things you do make me happy. Your smiles, messages, and care mean a lot. I keep them in my heart, even if I don’t say it.

Other times, your presence alone says what words can’t. A hug, a hand to hold, or just sitting together comforts me more than I can explain. I hope you feel the effect even if I stay quiet. It’s my way of showing love.

Sometimes your voice reaches me in ways words can’t capture. Even a simple “hello” brightens my day. I might not always say it, but it means so much to me. I hope you feel it too :>

At moments, I keep gratitude inside. For your patience, understanding, and efforts, I sometimes remain quiet. I hope my actions show how much I appreciate you, everything you do matters.

Sometimes I can’t admit how scared I feel. Fear of losing what we have or of making mistakes keeps me silent. I hope you trust that my silence isn’t distance. I just need time to process.

Other feelings are too big for words. Deep admiration, care, and love sometimes feel overwhelming. I hope my actions express them instead. I try to show it in ways you can feel.

Moments when I notice your habits and quirks make me smile inside. I treasure those details. they make you uniquely you. I hope you know how much I notice ;>.

Sometimes I stay quiet because opening my heart feels big. Sharing everything at once is hard, even with someone I trust. I hope you know it doesn’t mean I don’t care—it just means I’m learning to share slowly.

Your happiness matters to me more than I can say. Seeing you smile fills me with quiet warmth. I hope you feel my care, even when I don’t speak. You deserve joy every single day.

Admiration for your determination and kindness often stays inside. Watching you inspires me more than I can say. I hope my respect comes across even in silence. You make me proud every day.

There are moments I don’t express how much I value our bond. I assume you know, but I want to remember it too. My presence, attention, and care try to show it. We’ve built something meaningful together.

Sometimes I can’t admit my own insecurities around you. My doubts and fears stay inside. I hope you never mistake my silence for indifference, haaa. It’s just me protecting our peace.

Even the smallest things you do mean a lot to me, even if I don’t say it. Every kind word and little gesture stays with me. I hope you see that I notice and appreciate everything, you never go unnoticed.

Sometimes I’m difficult, and I hope you know I’m trying. My emotions can get the best of me, but I’m learning to handle them better because I care so much about you.

Sometimes I can’t voice how much I wish for your comfort. Seeing you carry so much makes me want to ease it. I hope you feel my care, even if I don’t say it. It’s constant.

Even when words fail me, I hope you feel everything I mean. Love, care, and admiration don’t always need to be spoken. I try to show them in my actions and presence. You mean more to me than I could ever say.`

Even though we’re young, I sometimes imagine a future with you. Not in a rushed way, but in a quiet, hopeful way. Just thinking about growing together makes me smile. I like picturing us learning, laughing, and figuring things out side by side :>.

There are moments I wonder what it would be like to face challenges together. Life won’t always be easy, and mistakes are inevitable. Even then, I hope we can support each other. That thought makes me feel comforted.

I like imagining us celebrating small victories together. Passing a test, achieving a goal, or finishing something we’ve worked hard on. Sharing those moments would make them feel bigger. I hope we can always cheer each other on.

Some days I notice how strong our connection already feels. It’s in the little things we share and the care we show each other. Those moments mean more to me than I expected. I hope we keep growing closer.

Sometimes I think about all the adventures we could have. Trips, walks, or even quiet days at home. They might seem ordinary, but with you, they feel special. I hope we get to share many of those moments in the future.

I hope we always find ways to understand each other. Differences, disagreements, or misunderstandings are part of life. I hope we learn and grow together through them. That would make us stronger, even young as we are.

Even in moments of distance, I imagine feeling close to you. Missing you doesn’t feel painful, it reminds me how important you are. I hope we always know how to bridge gaps. Our bond can stay strong, even with space sometimes.

It excites me to think of supporting each other’s dreams. School, hobbies, or goals, big or small, I hope we always celebrate them. Encouragement feels like love too. I hope we never stop being each other’s biggest cheerleaders.

At times I imagine trust growing deeper between us. Trusting each other with worries, dreams, and fears. That kind of safety makes love feel calm, not rushed. I hope we always feel secure together.

I like picturing our little routines years from now. Laughing at the same jokes, teasing each other in familiar ways, holding hands, hugging. Tiny habits like these can become lifelong memories. I hope we cherish them.

Even when life feels uncertain, I imagine finding comfort in each other. Challenges will come, but I hope we’ll always choose understanding over pride. Patience and care can carry us far and that thought gives me peace.

It makes me happy to picture us learning from each other. Mistakes, successes, and experiences are all part of growing. I hope we use them to become better, together. Even young as we are, growth can be beautiful <3.

Sometimes I imagine laughing with you years from now. Laughing at old memories, new experiences, and the little things in between. That shared joy feels timeless. I hope it’s something we can keep forever.

Other times I imagine comforting each other in silence. No words, just presence, hugs, and understanding. Those moments can speak louder than anything else. I hope we always make space for that kind of closeness.

Even at our age, I hope we learn patience together. With ourselves, with each other, and with life. Mistakes won’t break us if we keep trying. That thought keeps me calm and hopeful.

I imagine us growing individually but still choosing each other. Dreams, goals, and learning who we are can be separate journeys. But I hope we always meet along the way. That makes being together feel intentional.

Sometimes I think about the future and realize how much I want you by my side. Not because we have to, but because it feels right. Your presence makes life brighter. I hope we always choose to stay close ヾ(≧▽≦*)o

It feels comforting to imagine forgiving mistakes with ease. Misunderstandings and slip-ups are part of learning. I hope we approach them with care, not anger. That makes love feel safe and gentle.

Even though we’re young, I hope we can keep growing together. Learning, laughing, supporting, and loving at our own pace. I hope we cherish this time, this bond, and each other. If the future allows it, I hope you’ll be the one I grow old with; naturally, slowly, and happily.`

This letter holds everything I have been trying to say. It's built from moments that felt small at first, but over time, they became meaningful. They slowly shaped how I feel about you, and I hope you can feel just how deeply I notice and appreciate everything about you.

I think about how we started and how naturally things grew. Nothing felt forced between us. We just kept choosing to stay, and that choice still matters to me every day. That steady decision has created something rare and comforting.

You showed me that love does not have to be loud. It can be quiet and steady. It can exist in small, consistent gestures, in thoughtfulness and patience. That kind of love feels real to me, and I carry it in my heart.

Being with you has taught me that I am easy to love. I have learned that care can be given without conditions. I have learned that accepting love is not weakness; it is part of being human, and I am grateful to experience it with you.

I notice the little things about you. The way your eyes soften when you’re thinking. The small smiles you give when you’re pleased. The gentle way you reach for me, the care in your touch. Those tiny gestures linger with me long after the moment passes.

I notice your expressions, your smirk, your raised eyebrow, the way your voice changes when you’re excited. Each detail is unique to you, and I treasure them all. They are a map of the person I have come to love deeply.

I notice the way you are affectionate. The way you hold my hand, the gentle kisses, the calm assurance in your gestures. Every touch feels intentional, sincere, and meaningful. It reminds me that love doesn’t have to be loud to matter.

Our conversations matter deeply to me. Long talks, short talks, even comfortable silences; they all make me feel closer to you. Just being near you is enough. I notice the safety and warmth that exists naturally when we are together.

Quality time with you is never wasted. Doing nothing together feels like everything. Sitting side by side, sharing space, enjoying moments quietly, they all matter, and I hold them close to my heart.

I love how we find time for each other even when life is busy. We steal small moments between responsibilities. Those moments feel intimate and personal, and I hope we continue to make many more like them in the years ahead.

Physical comfort with you means more than I can say. A hug when one of us feels tired, leaning together, holding hands; it brings calm, reassurance, and warmth. I notice and treasure the safety it gives.

Sometimes we comfort each other without words. A presence alone can communicate love, care, and understanding. A small touch, a hug, or just sitting together quietly says more than words ever could. I notice and feel it deeply.

We have had misunderstandings and quiet days. Silence can be hard for me, but I still choose you. I stay because you matter, and because what we share is worth the patience, effort, and understanding.

The waiting during those moments teaches me patience. It shows how much I care, how much I want to nurture our love. It reminds me that love is a decision, and I continue to make that decision, every day.

I admire your responsibility. The way you keep your word, follow through, and consider how your actions affect others shows your thoughtfulness. I notice it, and I respect it more than I can say.

I admire your resilience. You face challenges with kindness and strength. Hardships never make you cold; they make you more understanding, more empathetic, more you. I notice how rare and beautiful that is.

I admire your sincerity. Everything you do comes from a real place. You do not pretend, and that honesty makes it easy to trust and love you. I notice how that integrity touches everything you do.

I admire your desire to grow. You strive to be better, not only for yourself but for the people you care about. Your effort does not go unnoticed. I notice and appreciate it in ways I cannot always express.

I notice how all your qualities connect. Your kindness, your strength, your thoughtfulness, they blend together, creating someone I respect, admire, and love deeply. You have shown me what it means to be steady, thoughtful, and caring.

You’ve changed how I understand love. I used to think love had to be grand, loud, or dramatic. But with you, I’ve learned that love lives in quiet consistency, small gestures, thoughtfulness, and care.

Love feels simpler with you. It doesn’t feel confusing or forced. It feels steady, safe, and real. That makes it easy to hold onto, and it makes me cherish it more with each passing day.

I think about the future you are growing into. The people you will continue to care for, the moments you will shape with your kindness, and the life you are building. I hope your heart always remains as generous and warm as it is now.

We are young, and life is still unfolding. Nothing is promised. But I hope for many years together, for laughter, quiet nights, shared adventures, and countless moments where we notice and appreciate each other. That hope feels honest.

I imagine growing older with you. I imagine change, and still, you are there. That thought brings comfort. It makes me feel grounded and safe, knowing we will continue to share life, notice each other, and support each other.

I notice all that you do, big and small. Every act of care, every moment you think of others, every gesture of kindness, it stays with me. It reminds me how lucky I am to have someone like you in my life <3.

This letter is a summary of everything I feel. It is built from moments, choices, noticing, and appreciation. It is simple, sincere, and deeply meant for you, Samm.

I love you for who you are, for how you show up, and for the quiet ways you care. I love you for the moments we share, the little things I notice, and the bond we continue to build. I choose you, today, tomorrow, and for all the years we are blessed to share together :3.`

content: `
I still catch myself wanting to check on you, even when I know it won’t change anything. It’s like a reflex I haven’t unlearned yet. Care doesn’t disappear just because it isn’t returned.

I open my phone with no real reason, just a quiet hope that today is different. It never is. And every time, a small part of me sinks a little deeper.

I keep wondering what you’re doing instead of answering me. Are you scrolling? Are you laughing? Are you just choosing not to think about me the way I keep thinking about you?

I replay the last time we talked like it’s frozen in time. I analyze your words, your tone, the way everything felt normal then. I don’t understand how normal turns into something like this so fast.

I keep checking if you’re okay. I worry about you even in your absence. That’s the messed-up part; I’m still here caring while you’re nowhere to be found.

I tell myself you might be tired, drained, overwhelmed. I want to believe there’s a reason that doesn’t hurt as much. But the longer the silence stretches, the harder that belief is to hold.

Sometimes I just want to ask you straight up; what happened? Why did you stop? Why do I feel like I’m talking to a wall that used to talk back?

Where are you, Sam?

Like genuinely, where are you.

Because I’m right here, and it feels so damn lonely being the only one standing in the space we once shared. :<<

I check your name like it might suddenly answer for you. Like it might explain itself. Like it might apologize on your behalf.

I hate how quiet everything feels without you. Not peaceful quiet, empty quiet. The kind that echoes too much and gives my thoughts too much room to spiral.

I get sad in waves. Sometimes it hits hard. Sometimes it just sits there, heavy and dull, following me around while I pretend I’m fine.

I’m tired of waiting for signs. Tired of hoping you’ll change your mind. Tired of checking my phone like it owes me something.

I don’t want to care less, I just want it to hurt less. But caring and hurting feel tangled right now, like I can’t pull one away without dragging the other with it.

So I start choosing myself muna, even though it feels unfamiliar. Even though part of me still wants to stay where you left me.

I stop checking as often. I stop expecting answers. Not because I got closure, but because I’m exhausted from not getting it.

I let myself be sad without blaming myself. I let myself admit that this hurts more than I thought it would :<

And if you ever wonder what happened on my side, this is it. I was here. I waited. I cared. And then I slowly learned how to walk away from the silence you left behind.`

You finally messaged one time, said you weren’t in the right state of mind. Thought you were confused, tired, maybe even lost. It was like a small crack in the wall you built around yourself. For a moment, I thought maybe we could fix this, that maybe you just needed time, not distance. But even with that, the silence didn’t fully break, it just stretched thinner, fragile like glass.

Knowing you weren’t okay didn’t make the wait easier; it made it heavier. Because caring for someone who’s lost inside themselves feels like chasing shadows. I wanted to hold your hand through the darkness, but you pulled back, probably afraid to let anyone in. That scared me more than the silence ever did. I wasn’t sure if you needed space or if you just didn’t want me at all.

It’s hard to watch someone you care about unravel, especially when you’re stuck outside their storm. I wanted to be your calm, your anchor, but sometimes anchors get dragged under the waves. I tried to remind myself that your mind wasn’t broken, it was just tangled in things you couldn’t say yet. But my heart kept breaking in real time, waiting for a sign you were still there.

I get that you weren’t ready, that you needed time to sort through your own mess. Still, it hurt like hell to be the one standing alone, waiting for a you that seemed farther away every day. I wanted to be patient, to give you room, but the silence felt like it was swallowing me whole. Loving you from afar was harder than any test I’ve ever faced.

Maybe one day you’ll find your way back, and maybe we’ll talk again with open hearts. Until then, I carry this ache knowing you weren’t ready, not because you didn’t care, but because your mind just wasn’t in the right place. And that’s okay. Because sometimes love means letting go, even when it’s the last thing you want to do.`

It’s been days now, days where your silence stays the same, even as exams pile up around us. I sit in class, trying to focus on my papers, but all I can think about is how you still won’t say a word. The tension doesn’t ease with time; if anything, it tightens like a noose. I keep hoping that after the exams, things will change, but every day passes with the same cold distance. It’s like time is slipping away, and you’re just letting us fade into silence.

The exam stress builds, but it’s nothing compared to the ache of waiting for you to break the quiet. Days turn into nights, and still, no message, no word, no sign from you. I wonder if you’re avoiding me or if you don’t care anymore. The unanswered questions pile up as fast as the exams, and I’m left drowning in both. It hurts that even when life gets busy and hard, you still choose to stay distant.

I try to tell myself that maybe you’re overwhelmed too, that maybe this silence is your way of coping. But the longer it lasts, the harder it is to believe. I’m stuck in this loop of hoping and doubting, wishing you’d make even the smallest move. Meanwhile, the exams come and go, but your silence remains. It’s a heavy weight on my heart that no amount of studying can fix.`

content: `
The exam room feels suffocating, but it’s not just the pressure of the test, it’s how every time our eyes meet, silence crashes between us like a tidal wave. I catch you looking, wanting to say something, but the words never come. My heart twists in that frozen moment, aching for connection but drowning in the quiet. That silent stare hits harder than any question on my paper, and I’m left wondering if you even want me near :/.

I overthink every glance, watching your eyes like they hold a secret I can’t unlock. Did I say something wrong? Did I do something to push you away? My mind spins in endless loops, dragging me down deeper into doubt. I replay our last conversations, searching for clues I might have missed. Every little moment twists into something bigger, and I can’t stop asking myself: where did I go wrong?

You used to reach out during times like this, even just a smile or a joke to break the tension. Now, it’s like you’re there but absent, your eyes filled with questions you won’t voice. I’m left wondering if you’re mad, drained, or if I’m just not enough anymore. The uncertainty BURNS ME ALIVE, making it almost impossible to focus on anything else. That feeling of being invisible stings deeper than any exam.

Every time I see your gaze lock with mine, I want to speak, to break the silence that suffocates us. But the words die in my throat, tangled with fear and confusion. I imagine every possible reason you stay quiet, maybe you’re hurt, maybe you’re confused, or maybe you just don’t care. That guessing game tortures me worse than any difficult problem set. The silence feels like a punishment I don’t understand.

I keep twisting over every detail, asking myself if I pushed you away with my friends or with something I said. Was I too distracted? Too needy? Too distant? My thoughts swirl endlessly, each theory darker than the last. The more I overthink, the more lost I feel, caught between wanting to fix things and fearing I can’t.

You stand across from me, your eyes searching but your lips sealed, and that stillness shatters something fragile inside me. I want to believe you care, but your silence screams otherwise. It feels like you’re a stranger hiding behind a mask I don’t recognize. That feeling breaks me, and I wish I could tell you everything without choking on my own fear. Instead, I stay frozen, wrapped in the cold weight of silence.

I try to drown the pain with studying my notes, but nothing distracts me from the knot in my chest. I want to focus on formulas and essays, but your quiet stare pulls me back into a storm of doubt. Every unanswered question feels heavier because the one I want answered the most stays locked away. It’s like failing a test that has no right answers.

Sometimes I catch myself hoping you’ll speak first, that you’ll break the silence and make this easier. But when you don’t, the ache grows sharper, like a wound that never heals. I start to believe maybe you don’t want to talk anymore. That thought crushes me more than any failing grade ever could. I don’t know how to fight a battle where only one side shows up.

I think about the moments before this started, the easy conversations and warm laughter we shared. I cling to those memories, desperate for a sign they’re not gone forever. But every silent look in class feels like a nail in the coffin of what we had. I overthink why it fell apart, was it me? Was it you? The questions don’t stop coming, and neither does the pain.

After exams, the hallway feels colder when our eyes meet but no words follow. I want to ask why, but I’m too scared of what you might say. So I stay quiet, pretending it doesn’t hurt, while my heart breaks a little more each time. The silence between us feels endless, like a test I’ll never pass. I wish I could rewrite the script, but I’m stuck waiting for a rewrite that might never come.

I feel alone, even in a crowded hallway, because the distance between us is invisible but vast. I want to bridge it, to speak first, but the fear of rejection holds me back. I’m tired of trying to guess what you want, but I’m more afraid of losing you completely. That tension knots my stomach and weighs on my soul. It’s a quiet torture I didn’t expect.

Sometimes I wonder if you’re overthinking too, wondering if I want you close or if I’m annoyed by your silence. Maybe you’re scared to make the first move just like I am. That thought both comforts and torments me. It means we’re both stuck, both hurting, both too afraid to break the silence. That shared pain feels like a cruel joke.

I want to believe this silence is just a pause, not the end, but the longer it lasts, the harder hope becomes. I keep telling myself that maybe soon you’ll speak, that maybe you still care beneath the quiet. But my mind keeps racing with all the ways this could end badly. The fear of losing you claws at me constantly. It’s exhausting.

I feel like I’m failing, not just the exams but you and us. I want to fix what’s broken but don’t know how. I want to be enough for you again, but I can’t figure out what that means anymore. The more I overthink, the more I shrink away from the person I used to be with you. It’s a lonely spiral.

Your silence is louder than any answer I could give on a test, echoing in every quiet moment we share. I want to scream at you to say something, anything, but the words get stuck. The more I try, the more I feel like I’m falling apart. That invisible distance between us is a chasm I don’t know how to cross. It’s breaking me quietly.

I keep hoping for a sign; any sign, that you still want to be close. But every silent glance feels like a no. I want to reach out, to bridge this gap, but I’m scared of what will happen if I do. That fear ties my hands and closes my mouth. I’m stuck between wanting to hold on and needing to let go.

The exams press down on me, but the silence between us feels heavier. I want to focus, but my heart is tangled in this unspoken tension. I try to push the thoughts away, but they keep coming back, louder each time. It’s hard to study when your whole world feels uncertain.

I wonder if you even notice how much the silence hurts me, or if you don’t care at all. Maybe you feel the same pain, or maybe you’ve already moved on. That uncertainty is the hardest part to bear. It’s a question I don’t have the courage to ask. The silence is a void swallowing everything.

I cry sometimes, when the pain feels too big to hold inside. Tears fall quietly, a release for the hurt I can’t say out loud. I try to hide it, but the ache shows in my eyes. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay when I’m breaking inside. The silence doesn’t comfortl; it isolates.

I feel like I’m losing myself in this waiting, shrinking into someone I don’t recognize. I want to fix us, but I don’t know where to start. The more I overthink, the more lost I become. Holding on feels impossible, but letting go feels like giving up on hope. It’s a constant struggle.

Every glance between us feels like a question and a warning, wrapped together. I want to ask you what you’re thinking, but I’m afraid of the answer. That fear keeps me silent, even when my heart screams. It’s a quiet kind of pain that never lets up.

I keep hoping the silence will break, that you’ll say something to make the distance disappear. That hope feels fragile but it’s all I have left. I’m caught between holding on and falling apart. The exams might end, but this silence feels endless. I don’t know how to pass this test.`

subtitle: "A Rare Warmth I Hold Onto",
content: `
We made up a few days ago, and it feels like the air finally cleared after a long storm. The tension that once tightened my chest loosens with every word we exchange now, softening the space between us like sunlight slipping through heavy clouds. Saying sorry wasn’t just a phrase for you; it was a bridge rebuilt with care and honesty, something I didn’t realize I needed until it was there. Since then, everything feels gentler, like the fragile edges of what was broken are now wrapped in understanding and patience. That moment marked a fresh start, rare and precious, and I hold onto it like a secret warmth beneath my skin.

Calling you for almost eight hours feels like the most natural thing in the world, even though it’s so rare. Our voices fill the silence that once stretched wide and cold, weaving together stories and laughter that remind me why I cared so much in the first place. Time loses meaning when I’m on the line with you, slipping away in waves of comfort and surprise, like I’m rediscovering a friendship and something more all at once. Each sentence you say carries weight and softness, like you’re telling me you’re really here now, not just in words but in presence. It’s wild how something so simple, just talking, feels like the most healing thing I’ve done in weeks.

I’m struck by how easy it is to laugh with you again, how our jokes land without hesitation or awkward pauses, and how silly we both get when the conversation meanders through nonsense. We stumble over words, share memories, and sometimes just breathe in the quiet moments that don’t need filling, like two souls comfortable enough to just be. It’s that rare kind of warmth where you’re not guarding your heart, but gently unfolding it, letting it breathe without fear of judgment or distance. The laughter builds like a soft fire, warming places inside me that felt cold and neglected before. I’m amazed at how something as simple as your voice can feel like home again.

When my mom casually walks into the room, I hold my breath for a second, caught between hoping you stay and feeling vulnerable under her watchful eyes. You greeted "hi tita," and she responded with "hello" balik in her usual tone, as natural and respectful as if you’ve always been part of this small world I carry with me. That moment surprises me, how easily you slip into spaces that used to feel so separate from us, like you belong in my life beyond the screen and distance. It’s not just a greeting; it’s proof that we’re blending our worlds back together, one small interaction at a time. That simple exchange stays with me long after she leaves, a quiet symbol of how far we’ve come.

The call stretches on, hours folding into one another like pages in a book I don’t want to end. We talk about everything and nothing, our dreams, fears, the little things that make us who we are, without pressure or expectation. I feel a calm I didn’t know I was missing, a rare peace that settles in the spaces between your words. It’s like we’re rebuilding a bridge, plank by plank, with each story and every shared laugh holding it steady. There’s no rush, no need to fill the silence; just a steady presence that comforts more than I expected it would.

Sometimes, I catch myself marveling at how this warmth feels so different from before, like it’s deeper, less fragile, and honestly, more real. The way you listen, the way you respond, it tells me you’re here not because you have to be, but because you want to be. That choice, that intention, shines through in the softness of your voice and the steady rhythm of our conversation. It’s a feeling I didn’t think I’d have again after the silence, a glow that quietly radiates through my whole being. I hold it close, knowing that rare warmth is the kind worth waiting for.

Even when the conversation drifts to silly nonsense or random tangents, I savor every second because it’s ours; unfiltered, unedited, and beautifully imperfect. We joke about old memories and make new ones with every shared smile, each one a stitch sewing up cracks left behind. The hours feel like a gift, a rare pause in the chaos where we just exist as ourselves, free from the weight of past hurt. I notice how much easier it is to be around you nowww, like a heavy fog has lifted and left clear skies in its wake. That ease is the kind of warmth that melts old fears :).

There’s a moment when you ask how my day is, genuinely curious, and I realize how rare that question feels after everything we went through. It’s not just politeness; it’s care wrapped in simple words :>, and it makes my heart skip in a way I didn’t expect. The softness in your voice when you say it makes me want to tell you everything, to open up without holding back. That moment feels like a promise, not just that you’re here, but that you want to stay. And that’s a rare kind of warmth I won’t take for granted.

Sometimes, in the middle of the call, I catch myself smiling so wide it hurts, overwhelmed by how good it feels to be heard again. The weight of those silent days starts to lift with each new sentence, replaced by something steady and true. I’m reminded that connection isn’t just about words; it’s about presence, intention, and showing up when it matters most. You show up now. I feel it. And it changes everythinggg. The rare warmth of your attention feels like light breaking through long shadows.

When the call finally ends, I don’t feel empty or lost, I feel full in a way I haven’t in a long time, even though it felt kulang haha. That rare warmth stays with me, like a blanket wrapped around my heart, reminding me we made it through the silence. We made up, and with it came a new kind of closeness, softer, deeper, and somehow more beautiful because it’s earned. I hold onto that feeling, knowing it’s real, knowing it’s here to stay. And that's everything.

The warmth of your voice, the rare way you stay, it lingers in my mind long after we say goodbye. I replay moments from the call, smiling at the little jokes, the caring questions, the way you said my name like you mean it. It’s like a quiet soundtrack playing beneath my day awdiesfjg, a reminder that this connection is alive again. That rare warmth isn’t just a memory, it’s our new reality. And I want to keep it that way.

I think about how rare it is to find someone who comes back not just with words, but with heart and effort. The way you apologized, the way you stayed on the call, the way you listened, the way you were checking up on me even when you were watching a movie, it all shows that you’re different now. It shows me you want this, want us. And that’s a kind of rare warmth that doesn’t come around often. I’m grateful for it. I’m holding on.

I’m happy now in a way that feels steady, not frantic or desperate. It’s a quiet joy that hums beneath everything, a steady flame I can carry with me. The rare warmth we found again isn’t loud or flashy, but it’s strong :3. It’s the kind of happiness that feels like home <3.

There’s still a softness when I think about what happened; the ghosting, the silence, but it doesn’t sting the way it did. Instead, it reminds me how far we’ve come and how much we’re willing to fight for this warmth. I don’t forget the past, but I’m not trapped by it. That’s growth. That’s healing. That’s rare.

Sometimes I catch myself hoping this is just the beginning of something new, something better than what we had before. The call showed me that’s possible, that warmth can return even after it’s been lost. And I want to believe that we’re moving toward something real and lasting. Because rare warmth deserves a chance to thrive <3.

As I lie awake after the call, I feel a calm I haven’t felt in a long time. The kind of calm that comes from knowing you’re still there, still willing to be present. It quiets the noise in my head, the overthinking and worry, and replaces it with something softer. 

I don’t know what the future holds, but right now, I’m holding this moment, the laughter, the words, the quiet warmth of your voice, and I’m grateful. For the second chances, for the patience, for the rare kind of connection that feels like coming home. And I want to keep building on that, day by day, call by call.`

Why did this situation come back again? It’s like we took two steps forward only to fall back into the same mess. I keep asking myself if I’m really the problem this time. Is it something I did, or something I didn’t do? The doubt curls in my chest like smoke, choking me slowly.

I wonder if it’s because I’m always with my friends when you want to talk. Maybe you feel like I’m too distracted or not really “there” for you anymore. But what about when I tell you I love your presence even in the middle of the noise? Why does that seem not enough for you now? It hurts like a fresh wound reopening.

I catch myself replaying every moment we had lately, searching for signs I missed. Was there a shift in your tone? Did you stop smiling the same way? Every tiny detail feels like a clue in this puzzle I can’t solve. I wish you’d just tell me what’s going on instead of leaving me guessing.

Sometimes, I think maybe you’re drained or overwhelmed by things I don’t see. Maybe it’s not me, but your own battles you’re fighting alone. I want to give you space to breathe, but the silence feels like a storm tearing us apart. That’s the cruelest kind of distance, the one where you’re right next to me but worlds away.

I try to respect your space, even when it stings. I stop pushing for answers because I don’t want to pressure you off. But the more I hold back, the more the gap between us grows. It’s like walking on thin ice that’s cracking beneath my feet. I’m scared one wrong move will shatter everything.

It’s confusing how you used to be the one who reached out first, who made time no matter what. Now, I’m the only one trying, and it’s exhausting. Or it's just me thinking that way. I question everything about myself, am I too much, too little, not enough? That question haunts me in every quiet moment. I hate how much power it holds over me, jud.

I keep wondering if I should stop hanging out with my friends so you’ll feel comfortable coming closer again. But is it fair to ask that of myself? Am I supposed to erase parts of who I am to fit into your world? That thought makes me angry and sad at the same time. It feels like I’m shrinking just to make space for you.

Even when I try to be alone, hoping you’ll come near, you don’t. You stay distant, lost in your phone or your own thoughts. That rejection stings like a slap I didn’t see coming. It’s a painful reminder that maybe you don’t want me the way I want you. That thought hits harder than any argument ever could.

I feel like I’m sinking into a quicksand of confusion and hurt. The more I try to figure things out, the deeper I fall. It’s exhausting to hold onto hope when everything around me feels unstable. But somehow, I can’t let go. That hope is the only thing keeping me afloat.

I wish you’d just be honest with me. Tell me if you’re tired, if you’re scared, if you don’t want this anymore. Silence is a poison that slowly kills what’s left between us. I don’t want to guess anymoreeee, I want the truth, even if it hurts. At least then I could know where I stand.

Sometimes, I’m scared that the real reason you pull away is because I’m not enough. Not enough to compete with your world, with your distractions. That fear wraps around me like a cold blanket I can’t throw off. It makes me question my worth and my place in your life. And that’s a pain I can’t easily shake.

I try to focus on the good moments, the times we laughed and felt close. But even those memories start to fade under the weight of this silence. It’s like trying to hold water in my hands, no matter how hard I grip, it slips away. That loss feels unbearable :(.

I ask myself if this is just a phase, something we’ll get through with time. Or is it the beginning of the end? That question terrifies me more than anything. I don’t want to lose you, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep trying.

I keep telling myself to be patient, to wait and hope you’ll come back. But patience is a thief that steals my peace. It makes me anxious and restless, waiting for a sign that might never come. That’s a heavy burden to carry.

I sometimes wonder if you even notice how much this hurts me. Or if you’re too caught up in your own world to care. That thought stings deeply, like rejection dressed as indifference. It’s hard to accept, but harder to ignore.

I try to distract myself with friends, hobbies, anything to fill the space you left. But the silence always creeps back in, louder than before. It reminds me that you’re still there, just not really with me. That absence is the loudest noise.

I’m tired of feeling like I’m chasing someone who’s running away. Like I’m reaching for a hand that keeps slipping through my fingers. That exhaustion settles in my bones and won’t let go. But even then, I still want to believe in us.

I hope someday we can talk honestly, break the cycle, and find each other again :(. Maybe then I’ll stop doubting myself and start healing. Until that day, I’m stuck in this space, half hoping, half breaking. It’s the hardest place to be.

So here I am, still asking why, still waiting, still wondering if I’m enough. Maybe the answers don’t come easy, but I’ll keep searching anyway. Because some things are worth the fight, even when they hurt.`

Second day of hurting, and honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. The ache feels heavier today, like it’s sinking deeper into my chest. I keep replaying our last conversations, searching for clues I might have missed, but it’s like they’re written in a language I can’t understand anymore. I want to reach out, but the silence between us feels like a wall I can’t climb over. Every minute without a word feels endless, and I’m left alone with my thoughts.

I’ve been asking your guy friends if they know what’s going on, hoping someone can fill in the blanks. But none of them has a clue. It’s like you’ve disappeared from everyone’s world, not just mine. That makes me wonder if this is more than just a mood, if it’s something bigger you’re battling on your own. I want to be there for you, but you keep pulling away, and I’m left standing outside your storm.

I know you’re the type of guy who doesn’t approach when you’re not in the mood. You retreat, go quiet, and shut the world out. I get that, really, I do. But what I don’t get is why you can’t let me in, even a little. I wish you’d let me be the one to hold your space when you’re drowning. Instead, I’m left wondering if you even want me there at all.

I keep hoping you’ll come back with answers or at least some sign that you’re still thinking of me. But the silence only grows thicker. It’s like you’re afraid to show weakness, or maybe you’re just too tired to fight. Either way, the distance is tearing me apart. I want to believe you’ll find your way back, but every day that passes makes that hope a little harder to hold.

It’s confusing because part of me understands your need to step back and breathe. I want you to be okay, even if that means stepping away from me for a while. But the other part of me feels lost, abandoned in the space you left behind. I keep asking myself if I did something wrong or if I wasn’t enough. Those thoughts spin around my head, refusing to quiet down.

I’m scared that this silence is becoming permanent, that you’re slipping further away while I’m stuck trying to hold on. The waiting hurts more than I ever expected. It’s exhausting to keep caring when the only thing I get back is emptiness. But despite the pain, I still want to believe that this isn’t the end for us.

I hope you find whatever you need in this quiet space you’re in. I hope you heal and figure things out, even if I’m not the one by your side when you do. I want you to be happy, truly, even if that happiness doesn’t include me. It’s a hard truth to accept, but it’s one I’m slowly learning to face.

I wish you’d understand how much I’m hurting, how much I’m trying. I want you to know that even when I’m quiet, I’m still here—still caring, still hoping. But I can’t keep waiting forever. I need to find peace for myself, even if that means stepping away from you.

So here I am, caught between holding on and just waiting. I’m learning that sometimes love means giving space, even when it feels like losing everything. I don’t know what comes next, but I’m trying to be okay with not knowing—for now.`

I feel really sad because you don’t want to come near me anymore, like there’s a wall you built that I can’t climb. When you say you can’t come closer because I’m with my friends, it hits me harder than I want to admit. I tell you I love your presence even if I’m not alone, but you don’t seem to hear me like before. You weren’t like this at first, and that’s what surprises me most about your reason for not approaching me. Still, I try to respect it, even if it hurts more than I expected.

You say it’s because I’m always “preoccupied” with my friends, and maybe that’s true, but I want you to know that it doesn’t mean I don’t want you close. I keep hoping you’ll make the first move even when I’m surrounded by others, but you never do. I try cutting back on time with them, hoping to be alone so you’ll feel comfortable approaching me again. But even when I’m by myself, you stay glued to your phone or whatever game you’re playing, and you don’t come near. That silence feels heavy, like a loud empty space between us.

I play CODM with my friend Felix, trying to forget the sadness you leave behind, but it doesn’t work. His jokes and energy help me for a moment, but then I remember your name is literally on my gun, and it hits differently. Every time I reload or shoot, it’s like a sting I can’t shake. I want to focus on the game, but my mind keeps drifting back to you—both so close and yet so far. It hurts more than I want to admit.

We’re online at the same time but don’t message each other, like strangers sharing the same space without crossing paths. That silence stings worse than any argument ever could. I keep wondering why we slid back to this place where neither of us reaches out. I’m stuck wondering if you still want me close or if I’m just fooling myself. It’s confusing and painful all at once.

I try to be patient and respect your space, but it feels like you’re pushing me further away with every moment you stay distant. You say it’s because I’m with friends, but I don’t want you to feel like you can’t be near me because of them. I tell you that your presence matters more than anything else around me, but it feels like my words fall on deaf ears. That disconnect between what I want and what you show me is crushing. It leaves me feeling small and unwanted.

Even when I’m alone, waiting for you to come close, you don’t. You’re there on your phone, scrolling or gaming, ignoring the space I’m giving you. That makes me feel invisible, like I’m waiting by a door that will never open. It’s painful to watch you choose anything else over me, even when I’m ready and waiting. The silence between us isn’t peaceful—it’s a loud reminder of what we lost.

Those days, when I’m alone and you won’t come near, feel heavy and dark. I feel disappointed and hurt in a way I didn’t expect. The sadness settles deep in my chest, and sometimes I cry alone because it’s the only way to release what I can’t say. I try to hold it together, but the weight of your distance breaks me more than I want to admit. The emptiness is suffocating.

My friends, Rj and the others, notice how I’m struggling, and they try to lift me up in their own ways. They listen, joke around, and remind me I’m not alone, but the hole you left still feels huge. Their support helps, but it doesn’t fill the space where you used to be. I’m grateful for them, but sometimes it feels like they’re only keeping me afloat while I drown in the silence between us. I wish you saw how much I’m hurting.

I feel drained every day, like my energy is slowly slipping away. I struggle to focus on anything meaningful, but I push myself to keep going anyway. The sadness makes everything harder, but I pretend I’m okay because I don’t want anyone to worry too much. It’s exhausting to carry this weight and keep pretending. Some days, the gloom feels like it will never lift.

I keep wondering what I did wrong to deserve this distance from you. You used to make time for me, show me that I mattered, but now it feels like I’m just background noise. That thought breaks me more than I let on. I want to talk to you, but I’m scared my questions will push you even further away. So I stay silent, holding the pain inside where no one else can see it.

Sometimes I try to fix things by changing myself—cutting back on my friends, acting different, hoping to be more “available” for you. But nothing seems to make a difference. You stay distant, and I’m left wondering if you ever want me close again. It’s a lonely cycle of hoping and hurting that I can’t seem to escape. I don’t know how to break it.

I watch you online, scrolling or playing games, ignoring me like I don’t exist, and it hurts like a slow burn. The silence between us feels heavier than any argument ever did. It’s a quiet pain that cuts deeper because it’s full of what’s left unsaid. I want you to reach out, to say something, anything, but you don’t. That silence speaks louder than words.

I’m tired—tired of waiting, tired of hoping, tired of feeling invisible to you. The exhaustion settles deep inside me, making everything harder to bear. Even so, I hold on to a small spark of hope that maybe you’ll come back to me. Maybe one day you’ll want to be near me again. But for now, the tiredness feels endless.

Every time I see you online but don’t hear from you, it feels like a fresh wound. I’m reminded that we share the same space but aren’t really together anymore. That feeling is worse than loneliness because it’s filled with what could have been. I don’t know how to fix it, and that uncertainty breaks me. I wish I could stop hurting like this.

I cry sometimes, when the sadness gets too heavy to carry alone. Tears spill out because it’s the only way to let go of some of the pain. I try to hide it from everyone, but the ache in my chest gives me away. It’s humbling and painful all at once. And still, you stay distant.

I feel like I’m losing myself in the waiting, shrinking into someone I don’t recognize. I keep holding on, even though letting go feels easier. The sadness weighs me down, but the thought of giving up hurts more. I’m caught between wanting you close and needing to protect myself. It’s exhausting.

I keep replaying the way things used to be—the way you smiled, the way you made an effort, the way you cared. Those memories haunt me like ghosts, reminding me of what we had and what we lost. I wonder if you remember them too or if they’ve faded for you like they have for me. That thought hurts more than I want to admit.

I want to talk to you about it, but the words feel heavy and risky. I’m scared that asking too much will push you away even more. So I swallow the pain and keep it inside, even though it burns. The silence between us feels endless, and I don’t know how to make it stop. I’m stuck in this painful space.

Even when I try to give you space, it doesn’t help. I pull back, hoping you’ll come closer, but the distance only grows. It feels like we’re trapped in a cycle where neither of us makes the first move. The loneliness is shared but unspoken, and it cuts deep. We’re near but worlds apart.

I’m left wondering if you still want me or if I’m just holding on to a fading memory. The sadness sometimes overwhelms me, but I keep going, hoping the silence will break someday. Until then, I carry this pain quietly, hoping it doesn’t break me completely. :>`

We’re finally back. That hug earlier felt like a soft reset, like the storm passed and now I’m breathing again. It’s wild how something so simple can carry so much weight, but it did. For the first time in a while, it felt like home again—the place where I belong when everything else is chaos. I’m thankful for this moment, for you, for us trying again.

I’m grateful I was the first to reach out because it meant I still believe in us, even when it felt like the world didn’t. Taking that step wasn’t easy, but it was necessary. It’s proof that hope isn’t dead, even if it’s been hiding under rubble. I want to fix everything, to sew the tears in our story quickly, but I know healing isn’t a race.

You need time, and I respect that more than I can say. I understand that sometimes people need to pause, to catch their breath before running again. I’m here, patient and steady, even if it’s hard. But I won’t lie—sometimes it drains me, feeling like I’m always the one moving first.

Still, the fact that we’re here now, trying, makes every tired moment worth it. I’m thankful for this second chance, for the spark that’s flickering back to life. I feel like I’ve regained something precious—a hope I thought was lost. It’s fragile but real, and I’m holding it close.

This feeling of coming home to you is something I want to protect fiercely. It’s not just about us—it’s about what we build between us, the safe space that we both deserve. I’m ready to fight for that, no matter how many battles come our way. Because some things are too important to give up on.

I know it won’t always be easy. Emotions will swirl like wild storms, and opinions—ours and others’—will try to pull us apart. But I want to hold on tighter, grip this hope like my life depends on it. Because it does. I don’t want to let the noise drown out what we have.

I’m learning to guard my heart better now, to shield it from the doubt and fear that creep in when things get rough. It’s a process, and some days I’m better at it than others. But every day I remind myself that love is more than just feeling—it’s choosing to stay, even when it’s messy.

I’m thankful for the quiet moments, the little signs that remind me we’re still here. Your smile, a gentle word, a touch that says “I’m still here too.” Those moments are anchors that keep me grounded when the world feels shaky. They’re proof that we’re not just surviving—we’re healing.

There’s a strength in forgiveness that I didn’t fully understand before. Letting go of the past hurts doesn’t mean forgetting; it means making space for something new. I want to fill that space with kindness, patience, and understanding. I want us to grow from this, not be trapped by it.

I’m aware that hope is a delicate thing. It can flicker out if we’re not careful, but it can also burn bright enough to light our way through the darkest nights. I choose to believe it will burn bright for us. I choose to believe in the “we” that’s still worth fighting for.

The future is uncertain, and that scares me. But I’m learning to embrace the uncertainty instead of fearing it. Because sometimes, the unknown holds the best surprises. And maybe our best days are still ahead of us.

I want to be honest with you, with myself, about the ups and downs. This isn’t a fairy tale; it’s real life with real feelings and real messiness. But that’s what makes it worth it. That’s what makes love alive—knowing it’s not perfect but choosing it anyway.

I’m thankful for you—your patience, your efforts, your willingness to come back. It means more than words can say. I see you, and I appreciate every little thing you do, even the things you think go unnoticed.

I’m ready to walk this road with you, hand in hand, even if the path is winding and uncertain. Because we’re better together, even when it’s hard. I believe in us, and I’m holding on tight.

So here’s to us, to new beginnings wrapped in old promises. To healing, to hope, and to the love that brought us back. I’m thankful. I’m hopeful. And I’m here, ready for whatever comes next.`

subtitle: "Holding On Through the Quiet Storm",
content: `
Today’s December 18, and I’m still deep in reflection—thinking about everything that happened, especially those moments when letting go seemed like the easiest way out. Not ending things completely, but just stepping back, taking a break, a cool-off to catch our breaths. It’s strange how most relationships don’t survive those breaks anyway, how the space can sometimes feel like a crack growing wider. But I’m really glad I held on, even when my mind whispered that maybe it was time to give up. That voice was loud sometimes, but my heart was louder.

I’m grateful we made it through the storm, because now we get to celebrate the year-end party together. All those photos we took—they’re like little time capsules of joy, moments frozen in laughter and warmth. They remind me of the times when it felt like nothing could break us, like we were invincible even in the face of everything. I miss you so much, especially when I got home today and everything felt quieter without you beside me. The silence hit different, like a reminder that I want you there—not just in pictures or memories, but right here with me.

It’s wild how the mind tries to trick you into doubt, how it creates fears and what-ifs that can make the heart heavy. But here we are, still standing, still together. Holding on wasn’t easy, not by any stretch, but it was worth every tear and sleepless night. I’m ready to keep holding on, to keep fighting for us, even when things get messy again. Because love isn’t about perfection—it’s about persistence, about choosing each other when it’s hard.

I admit, I get drained easily—mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically. It’s something about me I’ve been trying to understand and work on. I know it’s a red flag, something that probably made things harder for us at times. But I’m committed to improving, little by little, because I don’t want that to be the reason we fall apart. I want to be stronger, not just for myself, but for us too.

Sometimes, when the weight of everything is too much, my energy just vanishes like a candle flickering out. Maybe that’s why I sometimes pull back or get quiet, even when I don’t want to. It’s not because I care any less—it’s just me trying to protect what little strength I have left. I’m learning to recognize those moments, to communicate instead of shutting down, to ask for help instead of retreating.

I want you to know that when I seem distant or tired, it’s not about you—it’s about me trying to find balance in the chaos inside. I’m trying to be better at asking for space without pushing you away, because I don’t want my struggles to hurt us. It’s a tough line to walk, and I’m stumbling sometimes, but I’m committed to figuring it out. Because what we have is worth that effort—worth every challenge.

I appreciate your patience with me, even when I don’t say it enough. I know I’m not perfect, and sometimes my flaws shine brighter than my strengths. But you stick around despite those imperfections, and that means more than I can put into words. It gives me hope—hope that we can keep growing together, learning from each other, building something real and lasting.

So yeah, I get tired sometimes—more than I want to admit—but I’m not giving up. I’m choosing to keep moving forward, to keep fighting for us while also fighting to be better for myself. It’s a journey, not a race, and I’m grateful to have you by my side through it all, even when the road feels long and winding.

I’m learning that love isn’t just a feeling; it’s a series of choices we make every day. Choosing kindness when it’s easier to be angry, choosing patience when frustration knocks at the door. Choosing to believe in us, even when shadows creep in. That’s what keeps me hopeful—that the love we have can outlast the doubts and fears.

This year-end feels different because of you. It feels like a new chapter, a chance to rewrite the story with more understanding and care. I want to hold on tighter to the good moments, to the laughter and the quiet comfort of just being together. Those moments remind me that no matter what, we can find our way back to each other.

I’m thankful for every small victory—the conversations that bring us closer, the silences that don’t feel empty but peaceful. For every time you choose to stay, even when it’s hard. For every hug that feels like home. It’s those pieces that make me believe in us again.

There’s still work to do, and that’s okay. I don’t expect us to have all the answers, but I do want us to keep trying. Because the alternative—giving up—isn’t what I want. Not now, not ever.

So here I am, hopeful and tired, broken and brave. Ready to keep loving you, learning with you, and growing alongside you. Because what we have is worth every challenge, every tear, every step forward.

And no matter what comes next, I’m thankful for this moment—for us being here, together, still trying. That’s enough for now.`

subtitle: "One Year of Us :D",
content: `
It’s almost December 27, and I can hardly believe it’s been a whole year since we started this journey together. One year of laughter, tears, fights, and making up. A whole year of learning how to love someone imperfectly but fully. Sometimes it feels like time flew by, and other times it feels like we’ve lived a lifetime in these months. Either way, I’m grateful for every moment with you.

This year has not been easy for us. We’ve faced challenges that tested everything we thought we knew about ourselves and each other. There were days when silence filled the space between us, and it felt like we were drifting apart. But there were also days when our words and touches reminded us why we chose each other in the first place. Through it all, I’ve never stopped hoping for us.

I remember the first time we met like it was yesterday. The way your smile caught me off guard and how your eyes held a story I wanted to learn. That feeling of excitement mixed with nervousness, wondering if this could be something real. It’s funny how beginnings hold so much promise, and yet we had no idea what the future would bring. But I’m glad we took that chance.

Looking back, I see how much we both have grown, even if it wasn’t always obvious in the moment. I learned patience, the kind that stretches deep inside and teaches me to wait without losing hope. You learned to open up slowly, breaking down walls you thought were forever. We both stumbled, made mistakes, and hurt each other without meaning to. But we kept choosing to stay.

Sometimes I still get overwhelmed by my own fears and doubts. I struggle with feeling drained and unsure if I’m enough. It’s a constant battle inside me, and I know it’s not fair to you. But you have been so patient, so understanding, and that means everything to me. I’m trying every day to be better for us.

You have this way of calming me like no one else can. Just a simple hug from you can wash away the chaos in my mind. I cherish those moments more than you know because they remind me that I’m not alone. Even when things get messy, your presence is my anchor. It’s a feeling I never want to lose.

There were times when I thought about giving up. When the distance between us felt too wide and the silence too loud. But then I’d remember the little things—the texts, the shared smiles, the promises whispered in the dark. Those things kept me holding on when it was hardest. They reminded me that love is not always easy, but it’s always worth it.

Our fights hurt deeply, but they also showed us what we need to work on. Communication became something we had to learn again and again. Sometimes we failed, but sometimes we succeeded in ways that surprised us. I’m proud of how we keep trying even when it’s uncomfortable. That effort is the foundation we’re building on.

I’ve realized that love isn’t just about the good times. It’s about showing up when you don’t feel like it. It’s about forgiving the mistakes, the words said in anger, the moments of doubt. It’s about growing together through all the messiness. And we’ve done that, even when it scared us.

I want to thank you for sticking around, for not giving up on me or on us. Your commitment gives me strength when I feel weak. You remind me that we’re a team, and together we can face whatever comes our way. That sense of partnership means more than I can say. It’s the best gift you’ve given me.

This year has been a journey of discovering what love really means. Not the fairy tale, but the real, gritty, complicated kind. The kind that tests your limits and teaches you about yourself. I’m grateful that we get to write this story together. It’s messy, beautiful, and ours.

I’ve learned to be more patient with myself because loving you means loving all parts of me too. The parts that are scared, tired, or uncertain. I’m learning that growth takes time and that it’s okay to ask for help. You’ve helped me see that I don’t have to be perfect to be worthy of love. That realization has changed everything.

I appreciate the way you listen even when I’m not making sense. The way you hold space for my fears without judgment. Those moments of understanding build trust between us. Trust that lets us be vulnerable without fear. It’s something I treasure deeply.

There’s so much I want to say but don’t always know how to express. Sometimes words fall short of the feelings inside me. But I hope you feel it in every look, every touch, every time I reach for your hand. Because every part of me is grateful for you. For us.

I want to celebrate the little things too—the inside jokes, the quiet nights, the shared meals. Those moments that seem small but hold the biggest meaning. They remind me that happiness is found in everyday togetherness. It’s in the simple acts that make up our days. Those are the memories I hold close.

I know there will still be hard days ahead. Days when we don’t understand each other or when our fears get the best of us. But I promise to keep trying. To listen better, to love harder, and to never stop believing in what we have. Because it’s worth it.

This year has taught me that love requires courage. Courage to be honest, to forgive, to heal. It’s not always easy to be brave, but with you, I feel like I can be. You give me strength when I feel weak. And for that, I’m endlessly thankful.

I’m proud of how far we’ve come. Proud that we’re still here, still fighting, still loving. Sometimes I look at us and wonder how we made it through the toughest days. But then I realize it’s because we never stopped trying. And that’s what matters most.

As we approach our first anniversary, I want you to know how much you mean to me. You’re more than just my partner—you’re my best friend, my safe place. The person I want to share all my days with. I’m excited for all the years ahead, for all the memories we’ll create. Together.

I hope this year is just the beginning of a lifetime of love and growth. That we keep learning and supporting each other no matter what. That we face challenges hand in hand and celebrate victories together. I believe in us and the future we’re building. It’s bright because it’s ours.

Thank you for being patient with my flaws and for loving me through my ups and downs. Thank you for choosing me every day, even when it’s hard. That choice means everything to me. I see you. I appreciate you. And I love you.

I’m ready for whatever comes next because I know we’ll face it together. I’m ready to keep building, growing, and loving. To keep making memories and holding onto hope. Because this journey with you is worth every step. And I’m grateful for it.

Happy almost one year, my love. Here’s to us, to our story, and to many more chapters yet to be written. I love you more than words can say. Thank you for being you.`

Happy 1 year to us, Samm. It feels surreal to think that a whole year has passed since we began this wild, beautiful ride together. We’ve grown through so much—laughter, tears, challenges, and countless memories. Looking back, it’s crazy how far we’ve come from that first day. I’m so grateful we stuck through it all.

One year of learning to love each other in ways I never imagined possible. It wasn’t always easy, but every struggle taught me something new about you and myself. You showed me patience when I was restless, understanding when I was confused. We both made mistakes, yet here we are, stronger because of them. That strength means the world to me.

I remember feeling nervous about how this would all turn out. Would you stay? Would we last? Now I know the answer—because we did. Your presence has become my safe place, the calm in my chaos. That feeling is everything I could ever ask for.

This past year wasn’t perfect, but it was ours. We faced doubts, miscommunications, and moments of silence that felt unbearable. But we never stopped trying, never stopped choosing each other. That choice is what made the difference. It’s what makes us real.

You’ve been my rock when life felt overwhelming. Your support gave me strength on my darkest days. I’m thankful for the way you listen without judgment, how you hold space for my fears. Those moments showed me what true love looks like. I hope I’ve done the same for you.

I’ve learned so much about patience because of us. Love is not always fireworks and grand gestures—it’s showing up when it’s hard. It’s waiting, understanding, forgiving. That’s the kind of love we’ve built, and it’s something I treasure deeply. I’m proud of us for that.

We’ve grown together, sometimes in ways I didn’t expect. You’ve helped me see the world differently, taught me new ways to cope with my fears. I hope I’ve helped you grow too, in ways big and small. That’s the beauty of this journey—growing side by side. It’s not always smooth, but it’s ours.

There are moments I still catch myself smiling at the thought of you. Like when I see something funny or hear a song that reminds me of us. Those little sparks remind me how lucky I am to have you. You’ve become part of my daily happiness. And I hope I’m that for you too.

Thank you for sticking around, even when I made it hard. Even when my doubts and exhaustion showed up uninvited. You stayed patient, loving, and present. That’s the kind of love that changes everything. It’s why we made it this far.

I’m proud of the way we communicate now, even if it took some trial and error. Talking openly about our feelings hasn’t always been easy, but it’s brought us closer. It’s taught me to be more honest and vulnerable. I hope we keep building that trust every day. It’s what makes us real.

I cherish the quiet moments as much as the loud ones. The times we just sit together without saying much but still feel connected. Those moments remind me that love isn’t always about words. Sometimes it’s just being there. And that’s enough.

This year has shown me that love requires effort from both sides. It’s a two-way street that needs respect and kindness. We’ve navigated that road with all its bumps and turns. I’m grateful we didn’t give up halfway. Because what we have is worth fighting for.

I’ve learned to appreciate the small victories. Like resolving fights, making up after misunderstandings, and simply choosing each other daily. Those moments add up to something huge. They build the foundation we stand on. I want to keep building with you.

You’ve become my favorite person to share life’s highs and lows with. Your laughter, your voice, the way you care—it all feels like home. No matter what comes, I want you beside me. That’s how much you mean to me. You’re my person.

I know we still have things to work on, but that’s okay. Growth isn’t linear, and love isn’t perfect. I’m ready to keep learning with you, to face challenges hand in hand. That’s the promise I make today and every day after. We’re in this together.

This year has been a journey of learning how to love better. How to listen more, judge less, and be more patient. How to forgive quicker and hold on tighter. I’m grateful for the lessons because they brought us closer. We’re stronger because of them.

I’m thankful for every day we’ve spent together. For the smiles, the hugs, the late-night talks. For the support when life gets messy and the comfort when it gets lonely. Those are the moments that make love real. They make me hopeful for what’s next.

Sometimes I’m overwhelmed by how lucky I am to have you. To find someone who accepts me fully, flaws and all. You see me, really see me, and still choose to stay. That’s the kind of love I want forever. I hope I give you the same.

Our first year wasn’t just about love; it was about friendship too. Learning to be each other’s safe haven, best friend, and teammate. That foundation means everything. Because without friendship, love can’t survive. I’m grateful we have both.

You’ve helped me grow in ways I never expected. Challenged me to be better, to face my fears, and to open up. I hope I’ve done the same for you. Together, we’re creating a future that’s bright and full of hope. I’m excited for every step we take.

I’m proud of how we handle our struggles. We don’t pretend they don’t exist, but we face them honestly. That courage gives me confidence in us. I believe there’s nothing we can’t overcome. Especially with you by my side.

Thank you for your kindness even when I’m hard to love. For your patience when I’m distant or tired. For believing in us when I doubted myself. That faith is the foundation of our love. It keeps me going.

I’m learning that love is as much about giving as it is about receiving. About compromise, sacrifice, and support. I see that in you every day. And it inspires me to be better. To give you the love you deserve.

I want you to know I see you—your efforts, your struggles, your dreams. And I’m here to support you in all of them. Together, we can build the life we want. One day, one moment at a time.

There are still moments when fear sneaks in. When I worry about the future or if we’ll make it. But those fears don’t control me anymore. Because I have you, and that makes all the difference. You’re my anchor.

I’m grateful for the way you make me laugh, even on bad days. Your humor is a light that cuts through any darkness. It reminds me to enjoy the journey. To not take everything so seriously. That joy is a gift.

I want us to keep dreaming together. To keep setting goals and chasing them side by side. Because our dreams are stronger when shared. I can’t wait to see what the future holds. Especially if it’s with you.

Thank you for teaching me the power of forgiveness. For helping me let go of grudges and anger. For choosing peace over pride. That choice has healed wounds I thought would never close. It’s made our love deeper.

I’m proud of the life we’re creating. A life full of love, respect, and understanding. It’s not perfect, but it’s ours. And that makes it beautiful. I’m excited for what comes next.

Happy 1 year, Samm. This is just the beginning. I love you more than words can say. Thank you for being my partner, my friend, my home. Here’s to us—today, tomorrow, always.`

Hey Samm,

As the year comes to a close, I find myself thinking about everything we’ve been through and how much we’ve grown. This past year wasn’t always easy, but we made it through together, stronger and wiser. I want you to know how proud I am of you, of us, and of the love we’ve built. It’s not just about surviving—it’s about thriving, even when things get tough.

This new year feels like a fresh page, an open field where we can plant new dreams and watch them grow. I hope you see it as a chance to chase those goals you’ve been holding onto. Don’t be afraid to dream bigger or to take risks—you’ve got the strength and the heart to make incredible things happen. I’ll be cheering you on every step of the way.

I know life can sometimes throw curveballs, and there will be moments when you feel tired or unsure. But remember, it’s okay to pause and breathe. You don’t have to have all the answers right now. Just keep moving forward, even if it’s one small step at a time. Progress is progress, no matter the pace.

I admire how you’ve handled everything with such courage and grace. You inspire me to be better, to face my own challenges with that same kind of determination. We’re not perfect, but that’s what makes us human. It’s our imperfections and efforts that make this journey beautiful.

This year, I want us to hold onto hope tightly—hope for better days, for growth, for happiness. I want us to remember that even in the darkest times, there’s light waiting to break through. Let’s be each other’s light, guiding and supporting one another through whatever comes next.

I’m grateful for your patience and understanding, especially when things get messy or complicated. You’ve shown me that love is not just about grand gestures but about consistency and kindness. Those everyday moments mean the most. They build a foundation that lasts.

I hope this new year brings you peace and clarity, moments of joy and self-discovery. Take time to care for yourself and to celebrate the small wins. You deserve happiness in every form. Don’t ever doubt your worth or your ability to achieve what you want.

Let’s promise to communicate openly, to listen without judgment, and to grow together. I believe that with honesty and love, we can overcome any challenge. We’ve come so far, and I know there’s so much more ahead for us.

I’m excited for all the memories we’ll make—the laughter, the quiet nights, the adventures waiting to happen. Life is better when shared, and I can’t wait to share more with you. You make every day brighter just by being in it.

Thank you for being you—kind, strong, thoughtful, and real. You’re more amazing than you realize, and I’m lucky to have you. I hope this year reminds you of that every single day.

So here’s to a new year filled with endless possibilities. To growth, love, and all the moments in between. Let’s make this year our best one yet. Together.

Happy New Year, Samm. I love you, and I’m excited for everything coming our way.`

Today’s January 4, and I’m honestly buzzing knowing I can finally see you tomorrow after such a long break. It feels like forever since we last hung out, and I’ve been counting down the days. I can’t wait to give you the gifts—I seriously took forever thinking about what to get, trying to make it just right. Today’s not anything special, just me sitting here lost in thoughts about you and feeling this warm happiness in my chest. It’s wild to think we’re already over a year in, and honestly, I feel so lucky to be growing with someone as real and steady as you.

I keep catching myself replaying little memories—the way you laugh, how your voice sounds when you say my name, even those quiet moments where nothing needs to be said but everything is understood. It’s crazy how just knowing you’re there makes the world feel lighter, like I can handle whatever comes my way. Sometimes I find myself smiling for no reason, and yep, it’s always because of you. I’m lowkey counting down the hours until I get to be with you again, and it’s driving me crazy in the best way.

Not gonna lie, I’ve been overthinking some things—like, “Did I pick the right gift? Will you actually like it?” But honestly, that just means you matter that much to me. I want to surprise you, make you smile, remind you how much you mean to me in the little ways. I hope you’re ready for all the weird, extra, happy energy I’m bringing with me tomorrow, ‘cause I’m coming with full-on excitement.

This year with you feels like one of the best chapters I’ve ever written in my life. It’s wild to think how much we’ve shared already, and how much more there is waiting for us in the future. I’m excited for all the crazy, quiet, messy, and beautiful moments we haven’t even dreamed of yet. You’ve become my favorite person to grow with, and honestly, I wouldn’t want anyone else by my side through it all.

I’m also really grateful for how patient and understanding you’ve been, especially when I get tired or overwhelmed. It’s not always easy for me to show that side, but you’ve made me feel safe enough to be real. That kind of connection means more than words can say. I’m learning more about myself every day just by being with you, and I hope you feel the same way.

Sometimes, I wonder if I tell you enough how much you mean to me. So here it is: You’re amazing, and I’m so thankful you’re in my life. I’m looking forward to making more memories, more jokes, more everything with you. Tomorrow feels like the start of something new again, even though it’s just us picking up where we left off.

Okay, I’ll stop rambling now, but I just wanted you to know I’m thinking about you, feeling grateful, and super hyped for tomorrow. Can’t wait to see you and share all these little moments that make everything feel right. See you soon, Samm.

January 5, and yo, we finally met again! I swear, being tapad sa AdTech was lowkey the best part of my day. Like, no exaggeration, just vibing close and feeling that easy comfort we always have. It’s wild how just sitting near you can make everything feel instantly better. I missed this—just the chill, no fuss, just us.

I kept catching myself grinning like a dork the whole time. You have this weird power to make me forget all the stress and nonsense for a bit. Honestly, you’re like my favorite distraction, and I’m here for it. I don’t think I’ve smiled that much in a while.

And the way you said “hi tita” when my mom popped in? Bro, that cracked me up so hard. It’s those little random moments that remind me how easy it is to be with you. No awkwardness, just pure, goofy comfort. That’s the vibe I live for.

It’s kinda funny how being with you feels like coming home, even if it’s just for a few hours. You’re like that familiar playlist that makes everything better, no matter what kind of day I’m having. Can’t believe we’ve been at this for over a year now—it feels like forever and also like yesterday.

I’m still lowkey surprised how much I look forward to just hanging out with you. No fancy plans, just being close, sharing dumb jokes, and stealing snacks. It’s those small, random moments that hit different. You’re my favorite everyday kind of fun.

I swear, being tapad made all the noise from the world fade out. It’s like we created our own little bubble where nothing else matters. I needed that more than I realized. Just knowing you’re there, that’s enough.

I feel like sometimes we forget to just enjoy the simple stuff. Like, we don’t always have to have deep talks or big adventures to feel connected. Sometimes, it’s just about being present. And I’m grateful for that with you.

Honestly, I’ve missed your energy. The way you mess around, tease me, and just do you. It’s contagious in the best way. You make even the boringest days better just by being yourself.

I can’t wait for more days like this—where we just chill, laugh, and forget about everything else. No pressure, no stress, just us. That’s the kind of vibe I want to keep riding.

I’m also thinking about how lucky I am to have someone I can be this comfortable with. Not everyone gets that, you know? That ease and trust that lets us be goofy without worrying. I don’t take that for granted.

I hope you felt the same vibe today. Like, how nice it was to just be close again. Because honestly, I’m still floating from it. Can’t wait for the next time we get to do it all over.

Thanks for being my favorite “tapad” partner. Here’s to more days of just chilling side by side. No drama, just us.

Alright, I’m done being cheesy for now. But seriously, see you soon, Samm. Can’t wait for more moments like today.

I finally gave you the gifts today, and I’m so happy you loved them. I put a lot of thought into choosing each one, so seeing your smile made it all worth it. It’s crazy how small things can carry so much meaning when they come from the heart. I hope every little piece reminds you how much you mean to me. Honestly, I was a little nervous if you’d like them, but your reaction made me feel so relieved and happy.

Then you surprised me with a gift too—a whole three-page letter. I can’t even begin to explain how much that means to me. Reading your words, feeling your thoughts and feelings laid out like that, it touched me deeply. It’s rare to find someone who expresses themselves so openly, and I love you even more for it. Your letter made me feel seen and understood in ways I can’t fully put into words.

It’s wild how gifts can be both things and feelings wrapped together. The stuff we exchange isn’t just physical; it’s the time, care, and love behind it all. I think that’s what makes giving and receiving so special between us. It’s not about the price or the size—it’s about the thought and heart behind it. And that’s exactly what we have.

I’m grateful for how we keep surprising each other—not just with presents but with understanding and support. Your letter reminded me how lucky I am to have someone who listens and cares so deeply. I want to keep matching that energy, being there for you in all the ways that count. We’re growing not just as a couple but as two people who truly get each other.

Today felt like a reminder of how far we’ve come and how much more there is to look forward to. The little moments like this add up to something huge—a love that’s real and lasting. I want to keep collecting these memories, these gestures, big and small. They build the story we’re writing together, one day at a time.

Sometimes I think about how rare it is to find someone who cares this much. And then I look at you and feel lucky all over again. Your thoughtfulness, your honesty, your kindness—it’s everything I hoped for and more. I hope you feel the same way about me. Because I’m here, choosing you, every day.

Your letter made me want to write back, to tell you all the ways you brighten my life. But for now, I just want you to know I treasure it—and you. I’m so excited to see where this journey takes us next. Whatever comes, I’m ready, as long as it’s with you.

Thanks for being you, for every word you wrote, and for every moment we share. Today was special, but it’s just another page in our story. And I’m so here for it.`

YAYY WEDNESDAYY! I seriously love Wednesdays now because it’s the day I get to expect my bb time with you. It’s become this little highlight in my week that I look forward to so much. There’s something about knowing we’ll have those sweet, lovey-dovey moments that just makes everything feel better. I’m not even exaggerating when I say it’s like my energy recharges just thinking about it.

You’ve always been sweet, but lately? You’ve seriously leveled up. It’s like you took all the good parts from before and just turned them up a notch. I’m not complaining though—more of that please! Your lambing hits different now, and honestly, it’s the best feeling ever. I’m so lucky to have you being this extra adorable.

I love how natural it feels when we get all mushy. No awkwardness, no pretending—just two people who really care, being goofy and real with each other. Sometimes I catch myself grinning like an idiot because of the things you say or do. It’s wild how much love and comfort you bring with just your presence.

Even on days when everything feels hectic, knowing I have that “Wednesday bb time” keeps me going. It’s like a promise we make to each other to slow down and just enjoy the moment. Those minutes mean so much more than you probably realize. They remind me why this is worth holding on to.

You being sweet and lovey isn’t just for show—it’s real, and I feel it in every message, every call, every small gesture. It’s like you’re reminding me daily that I’m important to you. And you? You’ve become my favorite kind of happy. The one that’s soft, warm, and constant.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, thank you. For being you, for leveling up in all the right ways, for making Wednesdays something I genuinely look forward to. I’m excited to keep growing with you and to keep discovering all these little things that make us, us.

Sometimes I wonder how I got so lucky to have someone who’s not just a boyfriend but also my best friend, my favorite person to chill with. You’ve made even the simplest days feel special. And honestly, I wouldn’t trade that for anything.

So yeah, here’s to more Wednesdays filled with bb time, lambing, and all the love you keep showing me. I’m ready for whatever cute and crazy moments we get next. Because with you, even a Wednesday feels like a celebration.

Okay, I’ll stop before I get too sappy, but just know you’re the sweetest, and I’m so grateful for you. Can’t wait for our next bb time, Samm. Love you so much.`

So, I sent that really awkward message last night… yeah, you know the one. I’ve been overthinking every word since I hit send. Like, did I come on too strong? Or maybe I said something weird? Ugh, why do I always do this? But honestly, it was me being real and trying to tell you how much you matter.

I haven’t gotten a reply yet, and I’m lowkey still waiting, hoping it didn’t mess anything up between us. Silence can be loud sometimes, right? It makes my mind wander to all sorts of places I don’t want it to go. But I’m trying to stay chill and not jump to conclusions.

I just want you to know that no matter what, I’m here, and I care about us. Sometimes I get caught up in my own feelings and maybe come off a little awkward or needy. But that’s just because you’re important, more than I can really put into words. I hope you get that.

I’m not asking for anything crazy in return. Just a little sign that you’re there and you get me. Sometimes that’s enough to calm the overthinking storm in my head. I know you have your own things going on, and I respect that, but I miss hearing from you.

I keep reminding myself that relationships aren’t perfect and that sometimes we fumble with words or timing. That’s human. What matters is we keep trying, keep showing up for each other. I want to be patient and understanding, even when my heart races from nerves.

So yeah, just a little message to say: I love you, Sam. No matter the awkward texts or the silent moments, that doesn’t change. You’re still the person I’m rooting for, day after day. I’m holding onto that feeling even if things feel a little off right now.

I hope when you’re ready, you’ll reply, and we can talk it out like we always do. I’m ready to listen, to understand, and to keep building what we have. Because honestly, you’re worth every awkward message and every second of waiting.

Until then, I’ll keep being me—awkward, caring, and hopeful. Just know you’re on my mind, and I’m sending you all the good vibes from here. No pressure, just love.`
