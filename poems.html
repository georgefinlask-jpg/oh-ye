title: "Home in Your Smile",
content: `Every moment with you feels like home,
A place where my heart is never alone.
Your laughter lingers, soft and clear,
And every whisper draws me near.

The stars may fall, the night may fade,
But your warmth is a light that will never jade.
Your hand in mine, a perfect fit,
A silent promise, a gentle knit.

I watch your eyes, deep oceans of calm,
Every glance from you feels like a balm.
The world spins fast, yet here I stay,
Anchored to you, come what may.

Each word you speak, a melody sweet,
Each heartbeat of yours makes mine complete.
In storms or sunshine, in joy or fear,
My home is your heart, always near.

I’ll hold you close, through all life’s miles,
Finding eternity in your soft smiles.
Time cannot steal what we have grown,
For every moment with you feels like home.

With every hug, the world feels right,
Your love is my shelter in darkest night.
Even when silence surrounds the air,
I feel your heartbeat always there.

No treasure compares, no gold could shine,
Like the quiet magic of calling you mine.
Forever isn’t long enough to show,
How much my heart loves you, you know.

I find my peace in the way you stay,
In simple moments, day by day.
You turn the ordinary into something true,
Just by being you, just by being you.

When the world feels loud and pulls me away,
Your presence brings me back to okay.
You ground my thoughts, you calm my mind,
A steady comfort I didn’t know I’d find.

Every step feels lighter when you’re near,
Every doubt fades, every fear.
You don’t have to try or prove a thing,
Your love is enough, it’s everything.

In crowded rooms or quiet space,
I search for you, your familiar face.
Because wherever you happen to be,
That’s where home feels like to me.

I don’t need walls or perfect plans,
Just your warmth and your steady hands.
Wherever life decides to roam,
If I’m with you, I’m already home.

So if the world should change its tone,
And paths feel unsure, unknown,
I’ll follow the light I’ve always known—
Home has always been your smile alone.`

title: "Sun on Rainy Days",
content: `Some days feel gray before I wake,
The world is heavy, my heart aches.
I walk the halls with quiet steps,
Lost in thoughts, in lonely depths.

The sky outside is pale and dim,
My mind is heavy, my chances slim.
I barely notice the world around,
Until your presence is finally found.

Then I see you, just standing there,
Your quiet smile, your gentle stare.
The clouds inside me start to fade,
A little light begins to invade.

Even a glance can shift my mood,
Turn lonely silence into something good.
A passing word, a fleeting grin,
And suddenly I feel warmth within.

The minutes stretch, the hallways slow,
Yet time feels faster when I see you go.
I catch your eyes in the crowded room,
And all at once, the gray turns bloom.

The day feels lighter, the halls less cold,
Your presence bright, a sight to behold.
I don’t need hours or grand displays,
Just a spark from you to light my days.

Even small moments, a shared glance,
Make my heart skip, give it a chance.
A scribbled note, a whispered “hi,”
Can chase the storm clouds from the sky.

Rain may fall, and skies may weep,
My thoughts of you run soft and deep.
Though life feels heavy, my heart confined,
Seeing you makes the sun shine behind.

The world goes on, the day drifts by,
But your gentle light will never die.
Even brief moments, though few and small,
Bring me a warmth that outshines all.

I leave the school, the hallways bare,
Yet carry your light with me everywhere.
Though the clouds return and skies grow gray,
I’ll remember your sun throughout the day.

You are the spark that breaks the gloom,
The gentle warmth that fills the room.
Even in sadness, when hope seems thin,
You shine inside me, bright within.

Some days may start with sorrow’s haze,
Yet you arrive, my sun on rainy days.
A quiet presence, soft and true,
I feel the world is bright with you.`
},
{
title: "In Quiet Moments",
content: `In quiet moments, when the world feels slow,
When voices fade and lights hang low,
I find my thoughts drifting to you,
To all the small things you say and do.

The noise around me starts to thin,
And that’s where your presence slips in,
Not loud or bold, just calm and clear,
Like something meant to linger here.

I think of you between the days,
In empty halls and quiet ways,
When nothing asks for my attention,
But you still hold it without intention.

There’s comfort in the stillness there,
In knowing someone else exists somewhere,
Someone who makes the silence kind,
Someone my heart seems trained to find.

I replay moments, small and brief,
A passing look, a quiet relief,
The way the day feels less unsure,
Just knowing you’re somewhere near.

You don’t have to speak or stay,
Your presence changes things anyway,
Like peace arriving without a sound,
Like calm where chaos once was found.

In moments where I feel too much,
Your memory feels like a gentle touch,
A steady thought I hold onto,
When everything else feels untrue.

Sometimes I wonder if you know,
How quietly my feelings grow,
How even distance doesn’t break
The comfort your existence makes.

I don’t need promises or plans,
Just shared moments, unspoken stands,
Where nothing’s forced and nothing’s said,
But something real lives in my head.

The quiet doesn’t scare me now,
Not when I know you’re around somehow,
Even unseen, even apart,
You take up space inside my heart.

In stillness, I find clarity,
A softer version of reality,
Where thinking of you feels like rest,
And the noise feels less intense.

If quiet moments had a sound,
It’d be your name, soft and profound,
A gentle echo, warm and true,
That always seems to lead to you.

So when the world grows loud again,
And days rush forward without end,
I’ll keep these moments, small and deep,
The quiet thoughts of you I keep.`

{
title: "My Favorite Hello",
content: `You are my favorite hello each day,
The kind that gently pulls me away
From heavy thoughts and tired hours,
And softens things without much power.

It doesn’t need to be loud or new,
Sometimes it’s just a glance from you,
A simple moment, calm and brief,
That brings my heart a quiet relief.

I wait for it without a plan,
The second where our paths align,
Like time slows down just for a beat,
Enough for our worlds to gently meet.

The day moves fast, the hours go,
But everything pauses in your hello,
Not long enough to overstay,
Just long enough to make me stay.

It’s strange how something small can mean
More than the things I’ve ever seen,
How one soft greeting can replace
The weight I carry through the day.

I hold onto it longer than I should,
Replay it back the way I could,
The tone, the look, the way you smiled,
Like proof the day is worth the while.

Even when we walk our separate ways,
Your hello lingers, softly stays,
Like warmth that doesn’t fade too fast,
Like something gentle meant to last.

The world doesn’t know what it gives me,
That one small moment, quietly,
How it steadies me, helps me cope,
Turns ordinary into hope.

I don’t need more than what is shown,
No extra words, no overtones,
Just knowing you saw me there,
Just knowing we shared the air.

Sometimes goodbyes come far too soon,
And days feel heavy in the afternoon,
But I remind myself it’s okay,
Because I had your hello today.

It’s not about how long we talk,
Or how far together we walk,
It’s how that moment feels so true,
How it feels like something only you do.

Your hello grounds me, soft and real,
A quiet joy I always feel,
A simple start, a gentle cue,
That makes the day feel brighter too.

So if the world feels rushed or hollow,
I’ll keep waiting for that hello,
Because out of all the words I know,
Yours will always be my favorite hello.`
},
{
title: "The Spaces Between Us",
content: `There are spaces between our words,
Small pauses no one else has heard,
Moments where I almost speak,
But let the silence stay instead.

We sit so close, yet worlds apart,
Each carrying an unspoken heart,
I wonder if you feel it too,
The space that quietly pulls at you.

I notice it in passing glances,
In unfinished little chances,
In things we say but do not mean,
And things we mean but keep unseen.

The space is thin, but still it’s there,
A fragile line we do not dare
To cross, though sometimes I feel
It wouldn’t take much to make it real.

I trace the distance with my eyes,
Between your laugh and my replies,
Between the words we choose to keep,
And all the things we never speak.

It isn’t cold, this space we hold,
Just careful, quiet, uncontrolled,
A place where feelings softly stay,
Waiting for a braver day.

Sometimes the space feels safe and kind,
A place to hide what’s on my mind,
Sometimes it feels too wide to cross,
Like something gained and something lost.

Still, I don’t wish it away,
Not completely, not today,
Because even with the space intact,
You’re still the closest thing I have.`
}, 
{
title: "Waiting Without Asking",
content: `I’ve learned the art of waiting still,
Without a plan, without a will,
Not asking more than what you give,
Just letting moments come and live.

I wait in halls, in shared routines,
In in-between and almost scenes,
Where nothing’s promised, nothing’s sure,
Yet something keeps my hope secure.

I wait without a countdown clock,
Without a door I have to knock,
Just letting time decide its pace,
And letting you decide your place.

There’s no demand in how I stay,
No pulling you along my way,
Just quiet patience, calm and slow,
Letting what’s meant to grow, grow.

Sometimes waiting feels like rest,
Sometimes like a silent test,
But I remind my heart to breathe,
To trust what it cannot yet see.

I don’t wait for you to change,
Or suddenly rearrange,
I wait because being near,
Already makes the waiting clear.

The ache comes quietly, unannounced,
A shadow where my heart is trounced.
I feel it in the empty air,
The absence of a word you spare.

I watch the moments slip away,
The things I want, the things I say,
And though I try to let it be,
It still feels like a loss to me.

Sometimes I imagine what it’d take,
To cross the line, to bend, to break.
To risk the silence, face the pain,
And hope my heart won’t break in vain.

Yet still I wait, my hands unclenched,
My hope contained, my dreams entrenched,
In the quiet corner of my chest,
Where longing never comes to rest.

I fear the day this patience ends,
And all I’ve held so soft pretends,
That waiting was a foolish game,
And all I have is just my name.

But even in the ache, the sting,
There’s comfort in the quieting,
In knowing I could feel this deep,
Without a promise I must keep.

If someday waiting turns to more,
Or stays just this forevermore,
I’ll know I honored what I felt,
By never forcing what was dealt.

I’ll take the pain, the quiet hours,
The lonely thoughts, the unseen powers,
Because even in this silent ache,
My heart is learning what it can take.

So here I stand, not asking when,
Just waiting, now and then,
Because some feelings don’t demand,
They simply wait with open hands.`
},
{
title: "Ordinary Days",
content: `Most days look ordinary at first,
Nothing special, nothing rehearsed,
The same routines, the same old ways,
Just another set of hours and days.

But something shifts when you appear,
The ordinary feels less unclear,
The halls don’t change, the walls don’t move,
Yet somehow everything improves.

It’s not dramatic, not brand new,
Just small details tied to you,
A shared glance, a quiet sign,
That makes the moment feel like mine.

The day doesn’t sparkle or shout,
It just feels lighter moving about,
Like something warm beneath the skin,
A subtle calm settling in.

I still do work, still pass the time,
Still hear the same old rhythm chime,
But now the hours feel less long,
Because you’re somewhere they belong.

Nothing about the day looks rare,
If someone else were standing there,
But to me, it’s clearly changed,
Because you’re part of the exchange.

I think that’s how I know it’s real,
Not loud or hard, but how I feel,
How even days that fade away,
Mean more when you’re part of my day.

The cafeteria, the quiet hall,
All feel brighter though nothing’s small,
The shadows lift, the air feels light,
Because of you, the world’s polite.

Even the teacher’s droning voice,
Or the homework left with little choice,
Doesn’t weigh as heavily now,
Because I feel your presence somehow.

I catch your glance in passing time,
A fleeting look, a quiet rhyme,
It’s not enough for anyone to see,
But it’s enough to anchor me.

Sometimes the day returns to gray,
The moments fade, you walk away,
Yet still I carry what I found,
Your quiet light that’s all around.

I notice things that once seemed small,
Like how you pass the gym hallway wall,
Or how your bag swings soft and light,
These ordinary things feel right.

I smile at shadows you leave behind,
Little echoes of a heart aligned,
Even in the hum of daily grind,
I find your warmth in my mind.

The sky may dim, the hours drag,
The world may blur in its old tag,
But I know somewhere in the flow,
Your light turns ordinary gold.

So if tomorrow feels the same,
No different hours, no new name,
I’ll still walk in and quietly say,
This ordinary day is okay.

Even when the hallways empty out,
I feel your presence without a doubt,
A subtle magic no one can see,
That turns routine to memory.`
}, 
{
title: "Words I Keep",
content: `There are words I carry carefully,
Folded up inside of me,
Things I almost let escape,
Then tuck back in their hidden place.

They’re not dramatic, not too bold,
Just truths I haven’t ever told,
Feelings soft, but deep and real,
The kind I’m still unsure to feel.

I think them when you’re standing near,
Then swallow them instead of here,
Afraid they’ll change what we already have,
Afraid of what I’d lose or grab.

So I keep them quiet, safe, contained,
Letting moments stay unchanged,
Choosing silence over risk,
Choosing now over what-ifs.

Sometimes the words feel heavy there,
Sometimes light, like open air,
But always patient, always mine,
Waiting for the proper time.

I don’t regret the words I keep,
They’re part of something real and deep,
Proof that what I feel is true,
Even if it’s never said to you.

Each thought of you, a folded note,
A secret I have never wrote,
But tucked inside my heart to stay,
A soft reminder every day.

I sometimes wonder if you’ll see,
The quiet truths inside of me,
The way my chest still skips a beat,
When our eyes for one moment meet.

I imagine saying them aloud,
Breaking free, no longer cowed,
But fear holds gently, like a hand,
And keeps my words inside to stand.

Yet even unsaid, they still exist,
A steady, warm, invisible twist,
A presence felt in every glance,
A silent rhythm, a quiet dance.

If one day I let them go,
Or keep them always, this I know,
They mattered just by being real,
Just by existing how I feel.

Some words are meant to linger still,
To stay unseen, but move and fill
The empty spaces in my heart,
Where feelings live though kept apart.

I honor them, I hold them near,
Even if no one else can hear,
Because their weight is mine to keep,
Their echo soft, their meaning deep.

So I’ll hold them gently, not in fear,
Just honoring why they’re here,
Because some words don’t need a sound,
To know they’re strong just being found.

Even quiet words can shape the soul,
And make the missing parts feel whole,
A secret treasure, silent, true,
All tied to my thoughts of you.`
},
{
title: "Still Enough",
content: `Some days I feel like I’m too much,
Other days like I’m not enough,
But when I’m near you, somehow then,
The balance settles in again.

You don’t fix me or pull me through,
You don’t try to change me too,
You just exist, and in that way,
You make me feel okay to stay.

I don’t have to prove a thing,
Or be louder than I am,
I don’t have to earn the space,
I take up just by being placed.

There’s comfort in that quiet truth,
In knowing I don’t need to move,
That who I am is still enough,
Even when the days are rough.

I carry that with me when you’re gone,
That calm I felt when you were on
The same side of the room as me,
That sense of quiet security.

You may not know the role you play,
In steadying me this way,
But even briefly, even small,
You help me feel alright at all.

Even when doubt creeps in at night,
And shadows steal away the light,
I remember what your presence shows,
A gentle proof that I still glow.

It’s not in words or gestures grand,
Just in the quiet you understand,
That I exist and I am enough,
Even when the world feels harsh and tough.

I don’t need praise or constant cheer,
Your calm beside me is enough, dear,
A steadying hand, a quiet place,
A simple warmth I can embrace.

Sometimes being someone’s sun,
Is simply letting them be one,
And in that way, without a word,
You help me more than you’ve ever heard.

Even when life is loud and fast,
I hold this quiet peace to last,
A reassurance soft and true,
That I am okay just being you.

I take these moments, small and near,
And store them like a precious tear,
A proof that love can simply be,
Without demand, without decree.

If ever the world makes me feel small,
I think of how you hold it all,
The quiet patience, the softest grace,
The way you make a crowded space.

So when I stumble, lost or shy,
I look for you and realize,
That I am worthy, I am enough,
Because of you, in ways so tough.

And when I doubt myself again,
I think of how I felt back then,
Still, unjudged, allowed to be,
Comfortable quietly, free.`
}, 
{
title: "The Way You Stay",
content: `When I see you, the world feels slow,
The noisy halls don’t seem to go.
A little smile, a glance so kind,
And all my worries fade behind.

Your laugh drifts softly through the air,
A quiet sound beyond compare.
It warms my heart without a fight,
And makes the gray feel soft and bright.

I watch the way you move, just so,
Unaware of all I want to show.
The way your hair falls in the light,
The way you turn and look so right.

Even small things you do or say
Can make the heavy feel away.
A look, a nod, a gentle grin,
And suddenly the sun is in.

I don’t need hours, I don’t need long,
Just a tiny sign that I belong.
That you are near, that you are true,
That all my thoughts can rest on you.

Sometimes I hope you notice me,
Even in things too small to see.
The quiet way you stand, the way
You make the simplest part of day.

Even when we barely talk,
Or walk in silence down the block,
Your presence is a gentle light
That makes the hardest days feel right.

I think of you in passing time,
In sunlit streets or evening chime.
You linger softly in my chest,
A quiet warmth I love the best.

I wish I could tell you what I feel,
How every glance of yours can heal.
Even small words, or just a look,
Feel bigger than any book.

When life is loud, or nights are cold,
Your calm is something I can hold.
A gentle peace that stays with me,
A little home where I feel free.

Sometimes I fear I’ll never say
The things I think in quiet ways.
But even if I keep them in,
I love the way your light begins.

No treasure, jewel, or golden ray
Could match the gentle way you stay.
It’s simple, soft, and always true,
A little sun I carry through.

Even just seeing you today
Can chase the gray and clouds away.
A look, a smile, a tiny wave,
Can warm my heart and help me brave.

I don’t need much, I just need you,
A little presence, steady and true.
That’s all it takes to make me whole,
To make the ordinary glow in soul.

I love the way you make me see
The world feels brighter quietly.
No shouts, no rush, no frantic pace,
Just gentle warmth in your embrace.

Sometimes I think, if you only knew,
How much of me belongs to you.
Not loud, not wild, not hard to tell,
Just in the simple way you dwell.

I’ll carry this in every day,
The little things that light my way.
The way you stay, the way you shine,
The quiet sun that feels like mine.

Even if I never say a word,
Or walk beside you, unheard,
I’ll hold it close, both near and far,
Because of you, I know who we are.

And when the world feels cold or gray,
I’ll remember you, you light my way.
Simple, quiet, soft, and true,
The world is brighter just with you.`

title: "Where Your Light Rests",
content: `Some days feel heavy, dark, and long,
The world outside just hums its song.
The clouds may press, the skies unsure,
But then I see you, calm and pure.

A glance from you, a gentle smile,
Can make the gray feel bright awhile.
It’s not a show, it doesn’t need praise,
Just quiet warmth in simple ways.

I notice how you move, just so,
The gentle sway, the soft hello.
A laugh, a nod, a fleeting glance,
And suddenly my heart will dance.

Even when the moments feel too slow,
Or shadows stretch where worries grow,
Your presence softly holds me near,
A little light that feels sincere.

I think of you when sunlight glows,
Or when the night around me shows.
Your steady glow, your gentle way,
Can make the darkest sky feel day.

Sometimes I wonder if you see,
The quiet ways you mean to me.
It isn’t loud, it isn’t grand,
But still it reaches, still it stands.

Even when the world feels cold or wide,
I find a calm there by your side.
Your quiet warmth, a gentle guide,
A place to rest, to just reside.

I wish I could tell you how I feel,
How your soft light can gently heal.
Not every word must be expressed,
Some love exists when hearts are blessed.

You’re the calm when days are tough,
The gentle hand, the quiet love.
The smile that makes my heart feel bright,
The softest star in fading light.

Even if I never speak a word,
Or life rushes past with every herd,
I carry you inside my chest,
A peaceful place where I can rest.

Sometimes I want to reach and say,
The little things that light my day.
But words can fail, or seem too small,
Yet still your warmth outshines them all.

No treasure, gem, or shining gold,
Could match the light your presence holds.
It isn’t flashy, doesn’t demand,
But it makes my world feel gently planned.

I’ll hold this feeling, soft and true,
Through everything I think and do.
Even in silence, even afar,
You’re my quiet, my guiding star.

When life feels heavy, nights too long,
I hum the tune of your small song.
Your gentle glow, your steady rest,
Is where my heart feels truly blessed.

Sometimes the world forgets to care,
But I remember, you are there.
A quiet light I lean into,
A little home, my view of you.

Even in places that feel unsure,
I find your calm, your warmth, your cure.
It isn’t loud, it doesn’t press,
It’s steady, soft, and gentle yes.

And when the day is overdone,
I think of how your light has shone.
Through moments small, through all the tests,
I find my peace where your light rests.

No need for words, no need for show,
It’s in the way you make me glow.
A gentle warmth, so soft and true,
My quiet home is always you.`
