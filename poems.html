title: "Home in Your Smile",
content: `Every moment with you feels like home,
A place where my heart is never alone.
Your laughter lingers, soft and clear,
And every whisper draws me near.

The stars may fall, the night may fade,
But your warmth is a light that will never jade.
Your hand in mine, a perfect fit,
A silent promise, a gentle knit.

I watch your eyes, deep oceans of calm,
Every glance from you feels like a balm.
The world spins fast, yet here I stay,
Anchored to you, come what may.

Each word you speak, a melody sweet,
Each heartbeat of yours makes mine complete.
In storms or sunshine, in joy or fear,
My home is your heart, always near.

I’ll hold you close, through all life’s miles,
Finding eternity in your soft smiles.
Time cannot steal what we have grown,
For every moment with you feels like home.

With every hug, the world feels right,
Your love is my shelter in darkest night.
Even when silence surrounds the air,
I feel your heartbeat always there.

No treasure compares, no gold could shine,
Like the quiet magic of calling you mine.
Forever isn’t long enough to show,
How much my heart loves you, you know.

I find my peace in the way you stay,
In simple moments, day by day.
You turn the ordinary into something true,
Just by being you, just by being you.

When the world feels loud and pulls me away,
Your presence brings me back to okay.
You ground my thoughts, you calm my mind,
A steady comfort I didn’t know I’d find.

Every step feels lighter when you’re near,
Every doubt fades, every fear.
You don’t have to try or prove a thing,
Your love is enough, it’s everything.

In crowded rooms or quiet space,
I search for you, your familiar face.
Because wherever you happen to be,
That’s where home feels like to me.

I don’t need walls or perfect plans,
Just your warmth and your steady hands.
Wherever life decides to roam,
If I’m with you, I’m already home.

Outro:

So if the world should change its tone,
And paths feel unsure, unknown,
I’ll follow the light I’ve always known—
Home has always been your smile alone.`

{
title: "Sun on Rainy Days",
content: `Some days feel gray before I wake,
The world is heavy, my heart aches.
I walk the halls with quiet steps,
Lost in thoughts, in lonely depths.

The sky outside is pale and dim,
My mind is heavy, my chances slim.
I barely notice the world around,
Until your presence is finally found.

Then I see you, just standing there,
Your quiet smile, your gentle stare.
The clouds inside me start to fade,
A little light begins to invade.

Even a glance can shift my mood,
Turn lonely silence into something good.
A passing word, a fleeting grin,
And suddenly I feel warmth within.

Rain may fall, and skies may weep,
My thoughts of you run soft and deep.
Seeing you makes the sun shine through,
My rainy days feel bright with you.`
},
{
title: "In Quiet Moments",
content: `In quiet moments, when the world feels slow,
When voices fade and lights hang low,
I find my thoughts drifting to you,
To all the small things you say and do.

There’s comfort in the stillness there,
In knowing someone else exists somewhere.
The quiet doesn’t scare me now,
Not when I know you’re around somehow.

If quiet moments had a sound,
It’d be your name, soft and profound.
A gentle echo, warm and true,
That always seems to lead to you.`
},
{
title: "My Favorite Hello",
content: `You are my favorite hello each day,
The kind that gently pulls me away
From heavy thoughts and tired hours,
And softens things without much power.

Even when goodbyes come far too soon,
I remind myself it’s okay,
Because I had your hello today.

Out of all the words I know,
Yours will always be my favorite hello.`
