      title: "Home in Your Smile",
      content: `Every moment with you feels like home,
A place where my heart is never alone.
Your laughter lingers, soft and clear,
And every whisper draws me near.

The stars may fall, the night may fade,
But your warmth is a light that will never jade.
Your hand in mine, a perfect fit,
A silent promise, a gentle knit.

I watch your eyes, deep oceans of calm,
Every glance from you feels like a balm.
The world spins fast, yet here I stay,
Anchored to you, come what may.

Each word you speak, a melody sweet,
Each heartbeat of yours makes mine complete.
In storms or sunshine, in joy or fear,
My home is your heart, always near.

I’ll hold you close, through all life’s miles,
Finding eternity in your soft smiles.
Time cannot steal what we have grown,
For every moment with you feels like home.

With every hug, the world feels right,
Your love is my shelter in darkest night.
Even when silence surrounds the air,
I feel your heartbeat always there.

No treasure compares, no gold could shine,
Like the quiet magic of calling you mine.
Forever isn’t long enough to show,
How much my heart loves you, you know.`

      title: "Sun on Rainy Days", 
      content: `Some days feel gray before I wake,
The world is heavy, my heart aches.
I walk the halls with quiet steps,
Lost in thoughts, in lonely depths.

The sky outside is pale and dim,
My mind is heavy, my chances slim.
I barely notice the world around,
Until your presence is finally found.

Then I see you, just standing there,
Your quiet smile, your gentle stare.
The clouds inside me start to fade,
A little light begins to invade.

Even a glance can shift my mood,
Turn lonely silence into something good.
A passing word, a fleeting grin,
And suddenly I feel warmth within.

The minutes stretch, the hallways slow,
Yet time feels faster when I see you go.
I catch your eyes in the crowded room,
And all at once, the gray turns bloom.

The day feels lighter, the halls less cold,
Your presence bright, a sight to behold.
I don’t need hours or grand displays,
Just a spark from you to light my days.

Even small moments, a shared glance,
Make my heart skip, give it a chance.
A scribbled note, a whispered “hi,”
Can chase the storm clouds from the sky.

Rain may fall, and skies may weep,
My thoughts of you run soft and deep.
Though life feels heavy, my heart confined,
Seeing you makes the sun shine behind.

The world goes on, the day drifts by,
But your gentle light will never die.
Even brief moments, though few and small,
Bring me a warmth that outshines all.

I leave the school, the hallways bare,
Yet carry your light with me everywhere.
Though the clouds return and skies grow gray,
I’ll remember your sun throughout the day.

You are the spark that breaks the gloom,
The gentle warmth that fills the room.
Even in sadness, when hope seems thin,
You shine inside me, bright within.

Some days may start with sorrow’s haze,
Yet you arrive, my sun on rainy days.
A quiet presence, soft and true,
I feel the world is bright with you.`

      title: "In Quiet Moments",
      content: `In quiet moments, when the world feels slow,
When voices fade and lights hang low,
I find my thoughts drifting to you,
To all the small things you say and do.

The noise around me starts to thin,
And that’s where your presence slips in,
Not loud or bold, just calm and clear,
Like something meant to linger here.

I think of you between the days,
In empty halls and quiet ways,
When nothing asks for my attention,
But you still hold it without intention.

There’s comfort in the stillness there,
In knowing someone else exists somewhere,
Someone who makes the silence kind,
Someone my heart seems trained to find.

I replay moments, small and brief,
A passing look, a quiet relief,
The way the day feels less unsure,
Just knowing you’re somewhere near.

You don’t have to speak or stay,
Your presence changes things anyway,
Like peace arriving without a sound,
Like calm where chaos once was found.

In moments where I feel too much,
Your memory feels like a gentle touch,
A steady thought I hold onto,
When everything else feels untrue.

Sometimes I wonder if you know,
How quietly my feelings grow,
How even distance doesn’t break
The comfort your existence makes.

I don’t need promises or plans,
Just shared moments, unspoken stands,
Where nothing’s forced and nothing’s said,
But something real lives in my head.

The quiet doesn’t scare me now,
Not when I know you’re around somehow,
Even unseen, even apart,
You take up space inside my heart.

In stillness, I find clarity,
A softer version of reality,
Where thinking of you feels like rest,
And the noise feels less intense.

If quiet moments had a sound,
It’d be your name, soft and profound,
A gentle echo, warm and true,
That always seems to lead to you.

So when the world grows loud again,
And days rush forward without end,
I’ll keep these moments, small and deep,
The quiet thoughts of you I keep.`

      title: "My Favorite Hello", 
      content: `You are my favorite hello each day,
The kind that gently pulls me away
From heavy thoughts and tired hours,
And softens things without much power.

It doesn’t need to be loud or new,
Sometimes it’s just a glance from you,
A simple moment, calm and brief,
That brings my heart a quiet relief.

I wait for it without a plan,
The second where our paths align,
Like time slows down just for a beat,
Enough for our worlds to gently meet.

The day moves fast, the hours go,
But everything pauses in your hello,
Not long enough to overstay,
Just long enough to make me stay.

It’s strange how something small can mean
More than the things I’ve ever seen,
How one soft greeting can replace
The weight I carry through the day.

I hold onto it longer than I should,
Replay it back the way I could,
The tone, the look, the way you smiled,
Like proof the day is worth the while.

Even when we walk our separate ways,
Your hello lingers, softly stays,
Like warmth that doesn’t fade too fast,
Like something gentle meant to last.

The world doesn’t know what it gives me,
That one small moment, quietly,
How it steadies me, helps me cope,
Turns ordinary into hope.

I don’t need more than what is shown,
No extra words, no overtones,
Just knowing you saw me there,
Just knowing we shared the air.

Sometimes goodbyes come far too soon,
And days feel heavy in the afternoon,
But I remind myself it’s okay,
Because I had your hello today.

It’s not about how long we talk,
Or how far together we walk,
It’s how that moment feels so true,
How it feels like something only you do.

Your hello grounds me, soft and real,
A quiet joy I always feel,
A simple start, a gentle cue,
That makes the day feel brighter too.

So if the world feels rushed or hollow,
I’ll keep waiting for that hello,
Because out of all the words I know,
Yours will always be my favorite hello.`
